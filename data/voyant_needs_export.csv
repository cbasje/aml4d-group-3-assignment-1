2,Relieving Economic Burden for International Students Having A Delay.
3,"Both students and teachers are demotivated. I notice that many fellow students have forgotten how you invest in relationships that make group work emotionless and without involvement, even if you try to invest yourself"
5,"The lack of social contacts, I came to live new in Delft myself and I have not been able to meet new people yet. At first everything was online and the online guidance with teachers and fellow students ran out. Now that we can come again a day a week, that is a lot better and I like studying more fun. I do experience more problems with my back and neck due to a poor home workplace, I am also less moving and I notice that I feel less good because of this."
8,"Students could be on BK without a reservation to do group projects, for example. With the eternal zoom you get very tired and it is difficult to work together"
15,"Staring too much at a computer screen, having very little energy, being over stimulated. Not being able to be with too many people in succession, need more rest. have little inspiration and motivation."
20,On Campus Education. Basically the thing we all paid for and came to the Netherlands. This was the most amount of money that all students have ever spent on pre -prerocorded lectures and zoom (if you were lucky).
21,"I had little guidance from the TU when I was diagnosed with a burnout or depression. Especially from BME there has been little attention for the disappearance of me or helping to find a project. I understand that everyone is having a hard time and is busy, but I now have the idea that I have even become a song in a small master."
22,"Loneliness, fatigue, socially stimulated. Studying was much more difficult so I didn't show what I can do. I could have achieved higher figures under normal circumstances"
24,"Limited study places or the problem that Study & Sleep & Relaxation take place in the same place. Little contact with fellow students with whom I am not super good friends, making creativity and asking questions more difficult"
26,I would like to do group projects again physically
29,Proced exams are terrible!
31,"Concentration of problems during the lessons. More stressful exams, because they were usually planned in weird and non -useful ways, especially at the start of the Corona crisis. The best exams I have had were open book and that you can go back to previous questions you have already answered. Furthermore, the options to ask for help in my idea were less frequent and useful."
37,The Waiting Time for the TU Delft Psychologists should be decreased.
40,"I wish that the lecturers' Quality can be equally good. I felt so disappointed under the tutelage of my previous tutors who failed to comply with their duty in such a prestigious school. And yet, I have no choice but to move on. They have no group regarding my sitation. Instead, push me to continuous on my track without further explanation or clarification. I am Deeply Disappointed."
42,"The design of a home workplace, or the aid, as an announcement in Pulse/ Brightspace. Also ways to stimulate more to continue to develop yourself."
44,I had it and that has been sitting for a lot of fatigue around the period of one of my mid -terms
45,"Online education is jerk. people don't see is jerk. Sitting behind my monitor 10 hours a day is jerk. Yes I exercise, yes I pay attention to food, but this is just not healthy. I want to be able to move, live. digital = completely cunt."
52,"I found it difficult that I no longer had an income from the moment my student finance / loan stopped (this would also have been difficult without the Coronacrisis). I have been delayed by the Coronacrisis, so I was without income for longer than I had planned."
57,I don't know why it is but I am less motivated since the coronacrisis.
59,Tuition Fees for Academic Year 2020-21 Should Be Reimbursed AS International Students Are Paying Hindy Fees and Not Able To Enjoy Any of the University Resources. Paying So Much Takes A Toll On Their Mental Health and Dealing with Finance is a Crucial Part for Mental Well-Being. Please Refund Fees
62,"poor home workplace, no guidelines on camera on or off during lectures, graduating in total loneliness, little social contact, not being able to go to the university to study"
66,The shared labs where you could ask questions to TAs were now online. We as students have the idea that a TA can now cut a conversation much easier online than it is normal in a live setting.
67,"Lonely if you have a profession alone, the room is not optimally distracted quickly, so in the evening also and during the weekend also, do not grab a rest but also not effectively busy"
68,"miss physical education. During my studies (Architecture) you just need a teacher (and fellow students) who can sketch on your printed work and thus bring depth to the design. Some teachers prefer to teach digitally or come to the faculty as little as possible. This keeps communication difficult. Each guidance via Zoom also feels like a presentation moment, because it needs to be meticulously prepared (making slides, order of presentation, questions in advance). Physical education makes it all looser, causes less 'deadline' stress feeling and also leaves something to chance. In my opinion, digital education remains a forced form of communication and is less appropriate for a long graduation process. It was a long year for me, but in the end everything will be fine."
74,"I have noticed that as soon as you can no longer come along with the study rhythm, even though it is due to health circumstances that suddenly change without being able to do anything about it, that you are no longer seen and no one wants to help you to See what is still needed. I feel that if you are doing badly, nobody fascinates something and you will be left to your fate, even when you ask for help."
76,"Not allowed to go to the campus, TU Delft steering group that does not care about students and Knikken all Dreamteams without thinking."
77,"52,0162690, 4,386379"
80,Difficult communication via Zoom. feeling of loneliness. No exhaust valve for study and stress.
85,Graduating at home: reading literature and writing a report Only in your room is incredibly lonely and totally not motivating. As soon as it can have to be graduates really quickly go to the TU and physically with supervisors meetings.
89,Too much behind a screen must be the lack of social contact
93,"depression, anxiety no contact with fellow students and high need for a pyschologist but have months long waiting times and people who don't help you (even within the TU, the students are also worthless)"
94,"No blended learning, no blended learning. Really worthless way of teaching. Also no more online exams. never again. I just want to go into the lecture hall with an optimistic feeling that I will get things in the coming year and not as a result of endless home lessons and examination."
100,Not finished with a large group of fellow students.
104,"Normally I am a super motivated person of myself, but the last two months of the year I notice that it takes a lot of effort to sit behind your laptop all day and deliver work. Because of this I do not perform the way I would normally want."
107,"Social contact would be for me via AEGEE. But everything was online and then I don't know people well enough to participate comfortably. Also drinks in pairs is uncomfortable for me. Finally, everyone is about drinking. I don't drink alcohol and don't like the nightlife. It seems as if there is nothing to do for me. There are no activities for me and therefore I don't meet new people."
109,"I just can't study at home anymore. I was well on my way to my P, only the last quarter did not work anymore."
111,"1) Looking at a screen for whole days suffers from headache 2) requirements that are not reduced or even increased all its circumstances, causes a sense of misunderstanding and demotivation."
112,"I think it is very unfortunate that students have always stayed outside the picture with the government. We have never been appointed once during the press conferences. I find this very pathetic, also because, like all other people, we have had to hand in our freedom and physically the least bothered by the coronavirus."
113,"The Students Lives Are Devastated, They Have Lost All Their Incomes and They Couldern't Concentrate on Studies from Locked Small Student Rooms."
116,Without the ride to school and the scheduled time you will lose the structure.
117,"I feel that there is not always understanding from the training that you may not know anyone. As a result, making groups can become very stressful."
119,no
120,"The workload is still too high for this difficult period, I don't feel that the work has been adjusted to the situation. This makes it incredibly heavy to get through."
121,I need to talk to a therapist/gp. I've talked to the academic counselors and they are unable/refusing to help me.
122,The relocation with project enjoyed (especially online) was by no means as efficient as it could have been if the face-to-face on campus could have been. This has certainly had an effect on the time needed for assignments and the final results.
128,"Duration this Covid Situation, I've Found It is Difficult to Do the Group/Lab Assignment from Finding the Group Members/Partners and Doing the Assignment EspecaXLY AS International Student. Therefore it makes me worry about my academic sitation and worry that I Couldnt Finish in 2 years. If I Couldnt Finish in 2 Years, I Don't Know How to Pay the Tuition Fee for the Upcoming Years. thank you"
129,"Working together in groups for projects is frustrating, due to the lack of social control it is a lot less smooth."
133,"Little contact with supervisors, feel alone and little available from TU"
135,At the moment I experience little guidance during my Bep.
140,"Not specific problems with myself. Only I would like to let me know that I, and really many people around me have had the feeling of being abandoned. You feel that you are only there (together with your fellow students you know/ live with). It seemed as if the TU itself does not want to recognize the problem. There have been two surveys as far as I know, the first of which turned around the problem and it seemed as if the TU did not dare to ask how people really was doing, and this is a bit of the mustard after the meal. I still think it is very good that it happens, not that. In addition, little has really been undertaken (in my studies) to make education on location possible, or to search for something of social contact."
141,"The Rule About Paying Fees After May 31st Until August 31st Makes No Sense As I Myself Have Written Some of the Exams In My First Year in July. then why should I pay until August 31st when I have already graduated in June. Please do something about this. As Stress Due to Financial Burden (Especiate Duration Pandemic Times) is QUITE HIGH, A MULTSUDE OF FACTORS Including This Stress Have Contributed to My Declining Mental Health. While Measures Are Tasks to Reduce Tuition Fees for EU Students by 50 percent, Literally Nothing is Done in Favor of the International Students. Such Measures and Stoic Responses to Emergency Pleads, Make Me (An International Student) Feel Like the Money I Pay is Valued More than Myself. Doesn't this need a fix?"
148,Stress and fear due to performance pressure and too short of social contacts.
149,The quality of feedback with online guidance is lower. The lack of clarity around models in the design courses is awkward + I don't think you can ask for a model if there is not a room for structure to work on it for several days.
150,"Motivation Problems to sit back at home and be effective if there is no direct pressure behind it (deadline/exam), so that I am working from deadline to deadline"
153,"Low motivation, difficulty concentrating, feeling of loneliness, not very connected to knowledge/friends that I normally only see at university"
156,"In the time that I still lived at home, I barely felt connected to the university and fellow students."
162,"For myself, make the distinction between studying and relaxing. Because you study all day at home, it is difficult to get rid of it and and the threshold to do something in the evening is also low. I struggled to get rid of studying and really relaxing. That is much easier with physical education because you have a place for studying (the uni) and a place to relax (at home)."
164,"When Classes are physical again, it should be optional for physical attendance to be request - online options need to be avialy for all courses regardless of the physical class occurring. This past year has proved that a simulcast of Digital and Physical is Possible. Additionally, The University Needs to Allow Administration Forms / Academic Counselor Meetings to Be Digital AS Well. I found it very stupid that I had to travel for an hour one way just to deliver a form in person because e-mailing is not an option as its even insecure! Also I need tu delft to fix their Microsoft Licensing - I do not have access to many Microsoft teams features because I'm a student having to use my @tudelft.nl account in tandem with my @student.tudelft.nl account. (My Partner is in It and They Consistently Rag on Tu Delft's Poor Microsoft Architecture.)"
166,"Far too little physical contact with other students, Slow very poor comminucation with Proffessors if you have questions."
169,"poor accessibility of teachers, far too long waiting times for psychologists and study advisers, substandard preparation for Master Thesis, little contact with fellow students"
170,I would like to feel that the Tu Delft Cares About My Education
171,"Connection with Continuation Can my career after graduation, many online companies things etc. attended, but this didn't really feel like a success."
172,"The long days behind your laptop were very tiring (but understandable). In addition, it would have been nice if more study places were available faster, so that no longer was only in your room every day. The education of course had to give way to the Corona crisis, but sometimes it was made very difficult. I would have liked it if there had been a choice during my studies whether you wanted to take your exam online or physically (since Q4 2020 everything has been physically in terms of exams). I sometimes found that you had to come physically unnecessary, since this also happened just before the Christmas holidays when everyone went to his parents afterwards. When you missed an exam by Corona, it was made fairly difficult to request an extra resit. This actually only encouraged students to come to the uni despite any complaints or quarantine. The same applies to Lab; It was said very clearly that when you missed a day by Corona or something, it was not possible to catch up and that you have to do it again next year. I thought this was incredibly weird and also irresponsible. She threatened with a year off if you just followed the Corona rules. This was very bothering me and I also noticed the stress of my fellow students that they were really not allowed to miss a day. This while some students live in large student houses with more than 18 people. The chance that you must then be in home quarantaine because one of these roommates has been (possibly) in contact with someone is simply quite high. So you are actually punished during the 4 weeks of this lab when you just follow the rules. I don't think your students are going to blame students for this, but it also entails the fellow students. In addition, it was also fairly annoying (also understandable) that the BEP period continues for at least 2 weeks during the holidays. In addition to these 2 weeks, most students also have further outlet. I thought it was fair that the BEP students were met in this, since, for example, the number of Lab Days of younger Years had been considerably reduced (not just lab). A lot of feedback, but of course I also realize that it was also very stressful for the professors and for university staff. So wants to close with; thank you very much!"
173,Burn-out during graduation.
174,"Not being able to see/notice that if you are stuck or do not go well, there are often direct fellow students in the same boat."
175,"no new people meet, making it difficult to form groups of groups"
179,"What a weird/unclear survey, at a certain point the coronacrisis is at the top, ends and education moves towards a hybrid future. Which parts of the past year would you like to take with you to the future? Useful question, but then all statements are about the survey itself. Just about half of the survey consists of answering what you think of the survey ..."
183,"1) Studying continuously in the same place. The creation of a distance between study/internship moments and moments of rest was therefore difficult. What I missed the most is following lectures and working groups on location. 2) Graduating is already a relatively lonely process because you are mainly dependent on yourself. I think this was strengthened by Corona and working from home. Although I am well guided through my entire committee (I can hardly notice anything) this feeling remained. At a later stage, more 'activities' and digital meetings were organized. I don't know how this should be tackled differently."
184,Sometimes a feeling of misunderstanding that things are less obvious by Corona. And that the idea prevailed because it was just there you knew how you could deal with it and therefore had to do that.
185,"Study pressure was very high, especially for first -year students. You have to get used to a new city and new study, now with the Corona crisis, even more independence was expected from us. Occasionally it was very difficult to motivate yourself."
188,Little contact between Proffessors and Student. It was not pleasant/motivating to have to look back only from previous years instead of newly recorded lectures
190,"I found that the study adviser did not communicate well. I totally agree that no one is obliged to answer his or her mail within a day, but a week while I really did not be able to study, I find it ridiculous. Was very happy that I also have professional help outside the TU. I find it annoying not to be able to trust the TU."
192,"Many teachers and coordinators showed understanding via e -mails and messages on BrightSpace about the measures and that it is very difficult to study well. However, this was not reflected in the workload and expectations. We had as many deadlines and had to perform just as well as before. This led to extra stress."
194,"I think the pressure is too high. The BSA is lowered with five points, that doesn't make it any easier. During a pandemic, where a huge number of people have lost their lives, it did not feel like it was understood that the chance that someone died in the area was great. I myself have lost someone and I personally thought that there was no enormous understanding. I have to admit that I have not asked for a lot of help, but I think it might be a bit understood that not everyone will quickly board a study advisor or do such a wellness week. I hope that fear of failure, stress and burnout will be prevented, because I think this academic year was enormously tiring and sometimes really annoying. I like the study and I understand that many of them are outside the hands of the university/faculty, but I think it is good to say all."
196,"I give an example. My brother is in 6VWO, and together with a good friend they would study in Delft next year. However, the night before the first exam, the whole situation has become too much for my brother's friend. The stress, the uncertainty, the lack of social activities and above all 1.5 years are trapped in your own house became too much for him. Road exam, road study in Delft. There is no look at victims like him. There is no graph fallen young people due to psychological complaints as a result of the coronacrisis on the government's corona dashboard. People like this are forgotten; In all conversations, in all considerations, and in all evaluations. And that is unjustified, because they are also victims of the coronacrisis. I would have liked to see that universities would be a figurehead for how heavy young people are in this crisis. But instead they are the opposite: in my experience the TU only makes my problems worse."
210,"Too few contact moments with fellow students, too much online education, working too much on a computer, resulting in my neck and eyes, procrastination due to too little motivation at home."
211,"The survey is written in a past tense, it is a bit vague about what time span it is. ---- I am now working on the completion of my bachelor and I have never felt so bad. I spend all days at home and have daily breakdowns. To ask for help online I find more difficult than walking by someone. I hardly have more contact with fellow students, even though I need it."
212,"The house situation has become so grim since the Lockdown that a roommate has threatened with suicide last week (and seems as if this person wants to blame me and the other housemates). I already asked the study advisers to work at the TU for more often because it was not going at home, but I feel that they do not want to offer help. Shortly thereafter, study places opened again but never have the feeling that they are enough working hours for a graduation student. By filling in this survey (and especially this question) I think I have to contact the study advisor (or psychologist) again."
213,No good separation between work and private time High rising work pressure makes it even more difficult to maintain this separation
219,"Online meetings last all morning/afternoon or even all day. Often things also run out, so there are little or few breaks in between, so that I can no longer concentrate and feel bad about my studies. I don't really feel that last year I 'lived', because everything is so aloof, everything feels like a kind of online course, but not like real studying"
223,Lack of sport options
228,Lack of motivation and mental well -being
229,"Sleeping, studying, living in the same room is not fun. Very nice that you can now reserve study places. Attention at lectures online is also difficult, again physical lectures. this year no physical college due to minor and 3rd year subjects no rights"
232,Noise pollution on TU Campus. And not wanting to recognize this nuisance that causes this.
233,"For some courses, lectures are replaced by separate knowledge clips. Because of this you cannot ask questions during a lecture and because it is not live, you quickly slide it out for you to view. Knowledge clips ensure that the tire with the TU is becoming less and less. It also feels the teacher does not take the trouble to talk to you immediately. In the clips, the theory is treated very quickly as a kind of script, without a joke or a little lightness in between."
238,"no prospect, study pressure remains high or is higher due to online exams, the problem that you cannot or cannot alternate from the environment"
239,"There is much less contact with fellow students. In a hem, teams or whatever you do less quickly and you are studying more yourself. Because there are not many lectures at TB, I have weeks the idea of ​​yes ehm what should I do now. By giving some clearer lectures instead of just old recordings, you still have the idea that you have to do something."
240,- Little contact with fellow students and fewer friends -> More social fear - The feeling that you 'have to do everything on your own' - study long days/not a good balance between study and leisure time
243,"I would like to be treated as a student trying to learn education and a way of life about here Instead of Being treated Like Trash for not knowing something all the time. While that may be a tall ask, I really ask you people to consult up normal Departments So we can keep coming over and feel Like Students Again, Considering that a great percentage of the country has vaccined. Totally Unrelated: This survey works in Edge Only and not Chrome. Ironically you ask the opposite in your mail."
244,Motivation and lack of variety
245,"From the moment the quarantine started, I got into trouble with structure in my life. Constantly changing the measures has certainly not helped with this. We have returned a lot in quality and effectiveness because all meetings went online, I don't feel that enough has been done to compensate for this. I also have the idea that people do not understand how heavy students are talking if the structure of the university falls away."
247,"no or few contacts with other students, greatly reduced social life"
250,"As I have already mentioned, housing in Delft is extremely hard to come by at an affordable price so I wish tu delft provid housing for at least 3 years of the bachelor. Especially in a year where due to corona you don't know many people personally, it is very hard to find a good room. yeah but not sure that in the hands of the university"
252,"For the love of good, add more breaks between quarters .... I don't know one single student who is not absolutely burned out at this point of the academic year. I don't know if this is because of covid or if this is common at tu delft, but having one long break in the summer and practically no breaks."
256,"Studying at home brings an incredibly big challenge in the form of motivation and discipline. I noticed that the longer I was at home, the harder it became to work."
258,"It is really a big loss not to be able to study on campus, not to see your fellow students etc. And because you are only at home, you have plenty of time to study way too much, because there is nothing else to do. The problem is that nobody can study effectively for 10 or 12 hours for 5/6/7 days a week. I think the TU could have done more to keep the study load real (including through communication with teachers)"
261,ergonomic complaints
262,A need to be motivated to study for the exams in 2 weeks.
263,"I don't have a safe home situation, so that makes studying very difficult. I was allowed to sit on campus, but there was really nobody at all. So I still missed the distraction very much. You can zoom out or something, only that is so different than being with people in terms of getting distraction from your environment. So I really missed the safe place of Campus, where you really are in a different world. I had a lot of contact with the study adviser about my personal situation and I found it very difficult that it was online. You then discuss personal things that it is not nice if roommates hear that when they walk by. I also find it difficult to trust someone I only know online (I started this year at the TU) and then to discuss problems with it. So it would be nice if during a subsequent pandemic there would be an option to walk outside in real life with the study adviser to get acquainted."
264,"I would like more clear plans for the next year. if I would know it's mandatory to be on campus I would look for accommodation. Otherwise, I'll Plan Some Traveling While Studying Remotely. But these things take time and some clear plans for next year would really be helpful."
269,"Foreign policy of the Executive Board is short -sighted, don't care about students and only about their own liability. Do not realize how heavy MSC Cohort 2019-2020 is affected in terms of the quality of education."
272,"Personal distance between me and fellow students and me and the TU. The value that I attached to a TU diploma (in the past year) compared to a (for example) LOI course certificate has been a question that I have often asked myself, feels remotely as a LOI course, not entirely ideal. No income but all costs still have to continue to pay."
276,I have had the problem several times that I could not enter the CitG building for a study session. I also wanted to speak PhD students to half past eight and then to notice that I was not allowed in. I want access to my university again.
279,The most annoying: working from home/taking exams while the WiFi is bad and the internet provider indicates that the WiFi cannot be improved
280,"Working groups are certainly less efficient than offline online. When in a group with international students it is even more difficult (literally resolve in translation), cultural differences, low level of the English language, do not show up etc are all problems that occur. That gives a very negative and even poorer motivation and efficiency, this would be easy to solve by seeing each other more often. After a year of coronacrisis, it is still difficult to separate studying at home and not to study. There is always the possibility to continue. When I am alone, I notice that I am not taking care of myself. Skip meals, or haste, for example because there is still a meeting at a crazy moment."
287,"I need social contact and notice that my motivation level is very low when there are no mandatory lectures or working groups, because we had a lot of self -study, I noticed that I was doing everything for me"
289,"It was pretended from the entire university as if there was no corona and that it was no influence on the way of studying. But sitting behind the computer all day in meetings, is not the most efficient method of studying, certainly in comparison with ta's home lectures. However, zero is taken into account, so you usually spend twice as long in assignments."
294,"That my teacher no longer recorded the college because few people showed up. But during the lessons I received from him, I had other courses the year before."
295,"I really like that we can come to campus more and more often, so I can work and work together much better and ask questions."
298,"Sometimes it was difficult to find motivation to follow lectures on my own and to make assignments. There was often a possibility to ask questions, but often there was a long line to ask a question and it is a bit more difficult online than in real life"
300,"Physical lectures and studying on campus, I hope they will not be replaced with online environments."
301,"My motivation and concentration has fallen considerably in the last 1.5 years during the Corona. I am not good at studying online/ remotely. I tried different ways, but without results. I ignore my studies at the moment, which I feel a bit guilty about. Not the ideal situation, I look forward to a 'normal' study year!"
309,"Few known fellow students, little interaction, few activities, I have come out little, alienation from my environment, unsuitable living space, depression, gloom, if the weather was nice outside I didn't even realize it, poor school performance, little motivation."
310,"Colleges that I had to look back were sometimes not really focused on the viewers, think of using a pointer that you don't see at Legeerama, I have the feeling that we are a bit matted in terms of exams of exams and because of that feeling I find it difficult to estimate it how difficult such a university study really is"
311,"Little contact with people, but that had to do with a feeling of insecurity and fear of Corona. Despite good adjustments for a workplace, it was sometimes very difficult to work at home. With depression it is very easy to lock yourself up at home for days."
312,"I didn't understand the past tense of the questions. Furthermore, I fear that when we leave the epidemic will not change much. A general consensus that one must be useful is already in this survey. Yet I think you can have a vision of how it could go and not sit down. It is only difficult to find a balance between what you project on the other, but on the other hand your own I also adjust. I really enjoyed the movies of the rector and the math teacher. Especially those of the mathematics teacher. About mathematics and music. I also had an additional question for her: how could she use the two to describe humanity?"
313,"I did not suffer from problems during the coronacrisis in terms of education. Perhaps a problem was that my first project (I study electrical engineering) the moment it was useful to be physically present, was moved to online by the increasing infections. I respected that decision enormously, because I did not feel safe with my fellow students who were shit on the measures. Yet I thought it was very unfortunate to hear that a mechanical engineering student was allowed to go physically physically every week. This felt very skewed and unfair to me."
317,The combination of a smaller social life and sitting in my room all day made it difficult to stay motivated and concentrated.
321,"Not motivated to do something, often don't do anything behind my desk for whole days"
322,Subjects that are rather messy on BrightSpace are very tiring and time slurping. Does not really work well on the motivation
323,"I would appreciate it if the tutors were aware of the fact that students need a break from academic work, thus, not pushing too much conserving the limited academic environment. If I Slept Enough and had more time for recreation, I would feel a lot better."
325,I Need Discussion and Innovation
326,Social contact in The Academic Setting is Needed. Not just for free time
327,Not being able to watch his shoulders about another student and ask each other questions at that moment. Conversations on the corridors. The real io vibes. And constant distraction from games and youtube ... but mss that is a personal problem.
329,"I have a big problem with online education, I feel I am not motivated at all. But I keep pushing myself to finish what I have started."
330,"I was under the assumption that it would be a survey in everyone's opinion about what can be taken from the hybrid form of education to next year, instead of how I feel. In that respect, I think that for the good experience of education it should always be given 99% offline. And exams must always be taken offline. This ensures a completely different experience of the fabric and to what extent you dive into it. I would not have taken the amount of courses I passed this year if the exams had taken in the traditional way. So that works out well for myself, but it does reduce the quality of the program offered."
331,- No spontaneous encounters with fellow students - Motivation problems due to (1) a lack of relaxing activities and (2) the continuous dependent on yourself and your screen - interaction with teachers
332,"- Back and shoulder complaints of the many computers without a good chair - no reflection on your design process, because you do not have fellow students that you can compare with. - Sometimes a lot of stress whether I will get something on time. - Make very long days (8 hours to 11 pm), because I don't get home and because of this I have the idea that I have to continue working anyway. - Being able to alternate school with fun social activities and also get less and less looking forward to it. - The idea that you are not heard and this study only does a bit alone."
333,"I got a bit out of contact with friends, and I am now so used to studying at home, that I don't know how the switch to an on-campus study will go."
335,"I think the TU was not very much oncoming according to the needs of students. It took a long time before we could study on campus, there was a lot of hassle with online exams, etc., and some teachers let the students cook a bit in their soaked cooking what is getting to study and I think that was very unnecessary and that there was faster and more could be done. On the other hand, they are now doing well with the puzzle to bring as many students as possible to the campus and that is not the case with every faculty. I am especially disappointed in how long my faculty took to adapt to the situation."
337,Uncertainty in the run -up to online exams
341,Reason to Live
344,See previous answer. I feel very alone and only since 2 months do I see other students. I think that solid compensation should be given to students who have been living in crisis for a year and a half and do not receive any financial compensation for that!
350,"Because there is little social to do now, I notice that I and fellow students will spend even more time on Uni. I think it is healthier if there is a good distribution between relaxed/private life. Teachers come across unintellated to the webcam when they are sitting with their phone"
351,"Online lessons/lectures/working groups do not work. I hear this everywhere around me, but somehow it seems to be told the opposite on the news media every time. This is not correct and would like to raise it. It is very important that normal lessons can be given again in September."
354,"I am graduating, and it feels like I'm just standing for it"
358,Many Teacher Have Panicked because of Corona Crisis and They Overloaded BrightSpace with Material (in Many Cases Unsuitable for the Time Scale Avisable for The Student). The Same Problem Appears in Exams Which is Unfair for Students Who Focus On Depth And Quality Rather Than On Speed ​​and Quantity.
362,"You miss the possibility of asking a teacher in person. In Person you can ask the question a little better. Must say: some teachers are good to understand your question and to give a good, clear answer, so I have not been bothered by a few."
365,Meeting new people is now more difficult
366,I just want to finish my degree: D
368,"Maybe Some Professional to Talk to About Various Child of Problems Related to Pressure, Stress and Well-Being For Students. But Perhaps this is already available in some form?"
374,"- loneliness (nothing to do about it, fair Enough); - The evening clock led to serious depression for me, so that at some point I could no longer study (useful). Normally I am going to do something out in the evening (groceries, exercise) so that I can sleep with Piece of Mind (nothing to do from the university, Fair Enough); - The week off after semester 1 was disastrous for my mental health and I became depressed/angry with boredom and stacked frustration. This was no longer fast enough to make a good start with Semester 2. Starting my own project can start, but I have to finish something like that before I can really focus on the study again and 1 week is just too short; - At the end of Semester 1, 4 exams were planned for me in 1 day. The teachers referred me to the study advisor. He referred me back to the teachers on somewhat bijdehante, while I had really clearly explained that I had referred by the teachers. In the end I was only able to make 2 of the 4 exams (so on the same day). - At a certain point in Q2, almost all lectures were on the same days (concentration is already difficult via the computer). Looking back worked very well through Virtual Classroom; - Collaborating with other students was sometimes difficult: not everyone adhered to agreements made or responded in time for deadlines and some did not really seem interested in the full depth of the assignments (sometimes this was very frustrating). - I think it is well -known that plagiarism and fraud are not tolerated. Always emphasizing this made it difficult for me to see myself as part of TU Delft Community (especially if it happens electronically, because some illuminating humor is then impossible)."
375,"mental problems, too few social contacts, the feeling of losing friends"
376,Teachers need to know that there is a lot of pressure on students and take it more into account
379,"I have the idea that there is not really a weekend anymore. Every day runs open vaguely. However, I think it is difficult to find a solution for this, except to open the university more often. Perhaps something of study clusters idealize at the TU, where you can study in a small group o.i.d ...."
386,"Maybe less structure, but that is largely due to myself"
388,Studying completely independently and at home is not for me. I suspect that I will perform better next year.
391,The exams are made almost impossible. They are too long and spicy. I'd rather take all exams protoctored and at a normal level.
393,"Loneliness, Lack of Movement, Little time for hobbies, Feeling locked up, tired and drowsy by just working behind a screen"
394,concentrate while attending colleges at home. Lack of control with fellow students.
396,"I am personally very bad at individual work and Thrive on collaboration, sparring with students etc. As a graduate I missed this completely, a depression is added. Delay of more than a year is very likely."
397,"It was terrible to sit in my room endlessly. I mainly learn by talking to people about the material and much less from my book and from lectures. Because of this I put a lot of time into my studies without any results. In addition, I also experienced a lot of stress, because I love social contact a lot. I am sorry how last year went. I didn't get my BSA and it feels like I didn't have a fair chance."
398,"During the hybrid educational period, some things were reported plenary / physically to the group of students, but some students were in quarantine duty, they did not always get everything that was said because not everything was always absorbed well."
401,"Motivation was hard to find. Especially the usefulness of your actions, not knowing whether the future would ever return to normal, was difficult to portray. My worst home stay habits have also come up more. I have become more husy in the past year and a half and notice that I really have to get used to how people get back, as the world slowly opens again."
404,Little contact with people
405,"Mostly with the TU Delft itself. The University has a put a huge amount of stress and work on us although they knew we were stuck at home due to covid. When I Asked For Help and Addressed How Stressed, Anxious and Worried I Was, there was no reliable help and teachers didn't care at all."
406,"Gaming in contact with fellow students takes a lot of energy if it is not obvious, but that energy is difficult to bring if you have to put yourself to your desk every day, so you often don't really speak to anyone."
409,"You have no comparison material. You do not know where you are in an insufficient or a 7 etc. You don't know very well whether you are lagging behind the rest. Difficult to ask for help, because sometimes questions are not answered. It's like you're the only one doing this study."
410,"Ordinity in the courses, assignments and how and how much (possibilities for) help are offered. That really has to be better. I have also passed on ideas several times to the TU how things can be improved, but I have never received feedback about that and not noticed anything. As a result, I do not feel that these surveys really work."
411,"home college/ collaboration on projects works much better if it can be physically possible, prefer to work together physically for 2 hours than listen in the lecture hall, which is also possible at home"
412,"A lot of stress because you can't just do cozy with fellow students and keep each other sharp, little motivation and inspiration because you are not inspired by your environment at all (at home) at all"
413,2many Chief
414,"This year is though, give all the student some credit"
416,"There is not enough account of the negative impact that studying at home on the performance of courses. (Teachers may use the crisis as a reason why the lessons are worse, only the test moments are kept as if nothing has changed. Unfair and frustrating)"
418,"Work and Live at Home. No change of scenery, eSpeciate defling the winter months. My Personal Study Progress was good, however Lack of the Social Excitement is what makes you emotionless and gray about time."
427,Inability of professors with hybrid/online teaching. Thinking brainstorming sessions and ideas and group discussions are almost impossible online. Everyone forgets to give a break even after a year.
429,"concentrating while learning, because you are constantly in the same room and can go somewhere"
430,"Sitting too much behind a screen is very demotivating. Sometimes don't have to go outside for a few days in a row, it doesn't help."
433,"At the start of Corona, a number of my exams were moved to the next exam week, so I was extra busy (2 exam weeks in 1 actually). As a result, I have not achieved part of my courses, so that I can no longer finish my studies nominal anymore."
434,At the moment I just need some to talk with me.
435,"Often no hearing from teachers and often difficult to contact us via, for example, mail, and information seems to be withheld such as test exams. Using a forum also has disadvantages. Colleges sometimes of low quality with disturbing background, bad microphone and the teacher unprepared. Also not being allowed to go to the campus once a week is not nice. Study places on campus remain limited. Gigantically high study pressure Premaster students and sometimes schedule problems, with for example 2 exams of 3 hours on the same day."
440,"The Reason Why I Came to Study in The Netherlands is because the Education System in My Home Country Has Such Low Prestige. I really Enjoyed my ba at a different Dutch University, but the quality of education at tu delft was so inconsceivly low that I don't have for it for it. And what is sausage is that nobody (such as the study advisors or director of study) seems to care."
441,"I mainly suffered from dips, a period of 2 to 3 days that I didn't feel like anything, everything and everyone was stupid, I could not do social or be with groups of people. After those few days it went what weather, but I never had this for Corona"
443,"I find it very difficult that I feel like communication from TU Delft is going slowly and that therefore my normal life would soon get going slowly. I also feel like TU Delft is not really waiting for it to open again. This also because cafes in faculties are still closed, while they would be open again from the government. Why is this not done while this can get the social life of students going again? My studies at the moment don't mean anything to me - I don't really enjoy it. I really hope that TU Delft can continue and think about what students need. Especially in this time."
444,More on Campus Education. I cannot stress this enough.
448,I Want to Continue Studying Online. I Already Lost My First Master's Year Due to Covid and Learned to Live Like This. I am not in the mood to have to attend class or show up for exams. Everything online just makes it soo much nicer.
449,would be interested in the result of the wellness check
454,"It would be nice if teachers supply their curriculum in different ways: ie video, slides and text, so that everyone can choose what they want to use because not everyone can learn in the same way."
455,Social Interaction. Escape from the routine.
457,"I Need the Tu Staff to Actual Do Their Job. I am Waiting for Answer from the Exchange Office and Student Affairs Staff which They Seem Not To Want To Answer because it would mean extra off-time work for them, Although My Inquiry is very Rightful. As Each Quarter Goes by Me and All My Tu Student Friends Lose Hope in The Tu Especiate in How Coldly They Treat Students and Their Needs. Maybe it is special as an aerospace student with Extra pressure but it really blows my mind how non-chalant and not professional some TU staff is. Teachers are good, but exchange officers are a joke that has no regard for students."
458,I Don't Know
459,Not really experiencing problems
460,"For the Coronacrisis I didn't think it was great to be in very large groups, think of shopping in the city, but I feel that this has been worsened by sitting at home."
461,"Working from home is not possible in your bedroom, then they ask at Proctored exams that everything is completely tidy and you actually have to sit in a completely white room without anything on the walls really feels like those people don't think about real life at all. In addition, they also ask for silence while you can't do anything about it when a roommate is talking in front of your door. Point 3 unfairness in exams professors often also say that they make exams more difficult even if it is not entirely open book because some people do grab something that is not allowed. If you do not do that, you will be clear to it, for example, poor communication of teachers in an exam where you had to protest with certain questions to get points for it, the teachers then say that they have let a number of students know that if you have A certain thing has shifted something you should say to get points, but they say that nowhere at a point where everyone can read it."
463,"I am less motivated at home to get started, in contrast to the TU where you also see other students at work. I also had to catch up with a lot of work at a number of courses at the end, because you could not go to physical home lectures and I didn't go to work very well at home."
468,not necessarily something that the school can do about it
469,The possibility of following online college is a big plus. It would be nice if this was live with an option to be able to watch on demand later. Working in groups for developing assignments in their own time is also very valuable
472,More tired and concentration problems. is often accompanied by motivation problems and well -being Sometimes this is better than other times.
474,A Feeling of Community
476,The university sometimes pretends that she doesn't understand and does not see how heavy the students (can) have it in this time. This of course is not entirely from the TU but also from the government. The young people are generally very (perhaps the most) disadvantaged and we cannot keep it up for much longer.
478,"Taking exams at home was almost impossible for me. Last year during the measures I did not pass any exam, while I had achieved 42 ECTs in Q1 and Q2. This was a big damper for me, so I couldn't start a master this year"
479,Lack of options to be able to sit physically somewhere with fellow students with enough space and tranquility to really work.
480,I need at Least 50% Off the Fees to Make My Life Easier and Actually Be Paid Back For All The Facilities That I Had No Access To For 1 And A Half Year Now
481,find it difficult to contact supervisors for small questions and to ask for feedback
482,"Due to the loan system, quickly graduating is really a must. This causes a lot of pressure with me and students around me. Studying a year longer is not a disaster. No, but it costs me 10000 euros (home and study)."
484,"Having to study alone at home has caused most problems. First of all, I am someone who studies better outdoors, in a real study such as the library. There I can focus on my work, and I am surrounded by people and friends who are also studying and motivating me to continue working. I can also ask them for help if I get stuck and we can compare results. This helped me a lot in my bachelor at the TU. Because of COVID-19 I no longer have access to a similar environment and my productivity has fallen incredibly. I also know very few people on my master because I am a 1st year Master's student, and I only see my fellow students as names on my screen during college. So I hardly have anyone with whom assignments can discuss and with whom I can work together when I get stuck. This makes it considerably much more difficult to complete all deadlines in time. Finally, many lecturers have come up with that because of online education deadlines are a good idea to keep students involved in the lectures and the material. However, now I have so many deadlines (in Q2 on average 6 a week) that it is no longer possible to keep up with all my courses in terms of time and mentally, which means that I already have a delay without my reduced productivity. Also no direct contact with lecturers is difficult, because I have to look for a thesis supervisor in the future, and that would be a lot easier if I had already spoken my lecturers face-to-face."
485,"Economical Issues, But I Hope to Start Working Soon As Delivery Until Something Else Comes and Being Able to Afford the Living Costs."
486,"loneliness, boring"
487,"Online lectures work well with many teachers, so great to continue with. Give teachers enthusiastically to speak about their profession, because with some teachers who themselves appear tired and not very enthusiastic, I find it extremely difficult to keep my attention."
489,im good
491,"that TU Delft compared to other universities is at least committed, they only say that, but they do less than can and is allowed by the government to support the students"
492,"What I (And Many People I Talk To) Really Need is a more Relaxed Study Environment. The only people this school (at Least the Ae Faculty) is Tailored to are the success-oriented overachievers and Everyone Else is just left to rot in their misery when they realize that this school dosn'tn'tn'tn'tn'tn'tn'tn'tn'tn'tn'tn'tn'tn'tn'tn't Seem about anything else but success. Just Ask People if they're Feeling depressed or anxious because of their studies or the study environment. Also, we don't need all the fancy well-Being workshops and study counseling and all this stuff that sounds great on paper. What we really need is a Lower workload, More Days Off (You Can't Expect People to Work Their Ass Off for the Entire Year and Give Them One Week of Holidays in Between) and a Vibrant Student Life With Plentiful Extracurricular Activities. and on the topic of extracurricular activities; I got an impression that all these extracurricular workshops and courses are promoted as things to make you study more effective. As in: yeah, take a pottery class to take your mind of studying so you can study better later or sports are great for you, do sports so you can study better. And for the love of God, please hire more psychologists, we desperately need some. and More Educational Staff. These Poor Souls are just as well overrayed as we are."
498,Please Consider a Reduction of Fees for International Students. It is not fair that we are paying full fees fees the pandemic.
506,"This year there was hardly the opportunity to be part of a group with which your own work puts things into perspective and learning others was not really in it. This has caused a lot of stress for me, although this has been better in recent weeks"
507,"Mainly a more difficult balance between private and study. Because of Corona I sat down much more about my studies, so I had less time for family and friends. I also came out less and now I notice that that was really not good for me."
512,"Motivation problems, if I am not (compulsory) at the TU for lectures, I will postpone them too far, so I will eventually postpone courses to next year"
513,"reduced motivation; Much more difficulty with the mentally 'closing' of your studies at the end of the day, so that you are actually busy with your studies 24/7, which is very tiring; Working from home is becoming increasingly difficult, I really need the environment of a faculty to start; Because of the home working you have few spontaneous social interactions, I miss this very much; Seeing little to no fellow students is very hindering your design process (with IO), you just need those interactions for the progress of your process"
516,I Don't Feel Part of TU Delft
518,"For Master Thesis students who work individually on a report, there had to be more guidance. Perhaps that makes the thesis 'easier', but now it was impossible to achieve for a large part of the students. Reservations per half day part was terrible. I know it couldn't be otherwise, but 8 hours a week to the library was really too little. Tuition fees was way too much in my opinion, because I have been to the university 10 times. In addition, I only had contact a few times, so it felt like a LOI independent education."
523,I missed personal contact during graduation phase and has been delayed for many months.
524,"If you don't live in Delft like me it is very difficult to make friends of the study, the only good friends I made, I made during the intro week"
526,Lack of social interaction in real life.
529,Online exams is very annoying. This is the most important thing to have the campus again as quickly as possible
530,Online education is just not worth a jerk
532,"High workload. Teachers say easily: 'look back at home' or 'you have to sit on your spare time', but this is often not easy since a lot of time is in the subjects and staying with it. The meetings with project groups also take a lot of time. In terms of project groups, the reason is given to combine different tracks for more diversity and input. I understand this reason but makes it a lot more difficult to plan meetings since everyone has a different schedule. So a lot of time sits down in finding out which day comes out for a meeting. Sometimes you don't have to follow courses as a result and look back later. This makes it more difficult to keep up and feels a bit inefficient. In summary: a lot of work must be done, partly due to diversity in project groups, a lot of planning is required, often the result that meetings, among other things, take place on weekends and you actually no longer have 'free time' left."
534,"I am feeling a bit low, like the way I used to last year. My Efficiency is not the good and equally aftertaking some breaks, I just go back to being less productive."
535,"Because of an old concussion, I still have a little trouble looking at screens. Entirely online education was therefore not always nice to follow."
537,TU Delft to Make Things As Less Online As Possible
538,"I always believed that a 'sense of community' was not important. But after the coronacrisis I realize that I was wrong in that. As a graduating student at TU Delft (LR) I mainly have the feeling that when you're done you are a number that is checked. Because everyone starts and ends at a different time, you have little contact with your fellow students, the coronacrisis only made it harder. Ultimately, you are completely alone and you are only ready. Too bad that the last memories of student days are so individual and debilitating. I think that a system such as architecture with a fixed start time for everyone, fixed evaluation moments and a fixed end point would increase the feeling of togetherness and very probably a lot of thesis run -out."
539,"See previous answers, also refers to the quality of this check. Copy fit previous answer: What hybrid? Digital is not possible. The digital aspect must be better and higher quality. For this, material must be webcam+mic and the lesson has to be adjusted and improved for online lessons. The teachers do not do this on their own, these are lazy/tired and are busy. There can always be more lesson material, that money completely. Through digital sessions, teachers easily get rid of help and answer questions. Hybrid is not meaningful if part is still in poor quality for the online part. First improve the online part, only working with other students makes sense in hybrid education."
542,"I have felt more alone than ever before. I also find it difficult that I have been doing my master for a year, but no one I have now 'known' in real life. That is why I am also worried about projects that you have to form a group for next year."
544,"Little (spontaneous) contact with people. I sometimes feel lonely. Studying at home all day. Do everything in the same room (bedroom = everything). A lot with roommates, causing irritations. I can't travel."
546,"Well. annoying. What made me difficult this year in particular is that there has been zero comma zero spontaneous contact with other people. I have noticed that that is secretly quite important, to challenge yourself on a social level and to be active. In addition to all the other heavy trials of this year, I notice much less motivation for my studies. While I am now working on all kinds of internships and so a lot of you is being asked but you can also develop a lot. I think I have been able to develop to a lesser extent. I think we have been released too much because of the university. It is of course the question of who is the responsibility (about the well -being of students), but there was indeed a gap that could have been jumped in from the university. It is difficult for us as students to keep you involved with a pandemic and (for me then) to deposit me on my professional career. I think, I would have benefited if there had been a little more eye (university -wide) for the impact what this has on students and recognition for how you feel. Idk. But I do think that many students feel that they kind of fail this year because it was not feasible for many students who set a high LAT for themselves (as I do) this year to meet those expectations. And that is just difficult!"
548,"The entire coronage finish just cuts in, it is simply terrible to 'study' at home and I want to return to normal. Possibilities to meet other students and the like should be more available."
553,"Loneliness, feeling a threshold to meet people, bad habits in terms of food and rhythm, a lot of stress due to moderate divorce working time, study time and time to relax, a lot of uncertainty in my thesis process because you only know what others do"
554,"I feel like I need more time ... there are too many things to do and too little time until the start of exam season. I Feel Very Overhelmed, So Flexibility from Professors would be Amazing (Even Though They're Already Being Very Flexible, So Requesting This Feels Like Asking Too Much)."
555,"Taking online exams was not nice. As a graduation student, I feel forgotten now that the study time is reserved for physical education, and as a graduation player I have no courses, so I am no longer allowed to use self -study spots because they are no longer there."
557,Online lectures were very bad.
558,"TU Delft does a lot about it in general Nivieau, the teachers pretend that there are no problems. Students get stuck with courses and can hardly get any help. Of course, teachers have the same problem and they cannot blame them. It would be better if teachers would make some effort to make the best of the situation, not all solutions always have to get rid of higher."
559,Little concentration and loss of motivation. I am not friends with anyone. I cannot find a room because of the bizarre bustle that is now in the room market of all the current 1st year and the upcoming 1st year looking for a room. had too few contact hours for many subjects. Bad communication with teachers
560,Friendship :(
566,Lack of social contact
567,I have noticed that my concentration eye is very small. Because of this I don't perform at my best. And I have the idea that not all teachers realize what the students go through this period.
568,"I often felt lonely because I had little contact with people. Furthermore, I often felt locked up because I could no longer practice my sport. Furthermore, I felt like my mother lay on her deathbed and none of the university asked how I was doing, but left me alone. At such a moment the initiative must come."
570,"The administration (from the ae faculty in My Case) should be more transparent about the upcoming months and the education that we will recyive. Professors Have Expressed Their Satisfaction with the Current Learning Model, Stating that the Performance of the Students Have Increased With Less Stress On Their Part. Hence, it does not seem as thought they are concerned with how long it will take to get back to on-site learning. AltheHe I am a Tu Delft Student, I have never set foot in my faculty which makes it difficult for me to associate myself to the community and feel the energy of being at a scientific university. Althegh the Current Education Has Been of High Quality, It Must Be Kept In Mind That It Is Not Sustainable - Engineering Students Need The Stimulus of Learning Around Others and Having Access to Labs."
571,I find it annoying that there is no clear feedback on these surveys.
572,Little movement. Little new experiences.
579,"Especially the contact via Zoom is not the same as the contact on the faculty. A conversation with a professor at the faculty is much more efficient. In Zoom you are only sending back and forth and it just doesn't always look good. The sketching of examples is also much more difficult, but again, I understand that there is no different thing at the moment."
582,"The quality of education was very minimal through the home working group. Social and school life were mixed up, so that there was continuous stress of study. In addition to missing social contacts, I also missed gaining new knowledge. I experienced studying at home, especially when the breakthrough on my own knowledge then really broadening my knowledge."
583,Possibility of physical social contact inside and outside faculty
584,TU Delft Housing Problem is alarm. You are evicting your students
588,"Especially less physical lesson made me get to know fewer people and also that I have spoken to virtually none of my coaches. I also have the idea that online lessons always had a very short time to ask questions and could not really work with fellow students, I learned less and had less motivation to improve things."
589,"loneliness. Studying alone all day at home, the study pressure and feedback for the design projects come very personal and now I really have the idea that I am all alone for it. That has become too much for me several times."
590,"Many things are too difficult/complicated arranged. To find out somewhere you often have to click via 3 different BrightSpace pages, simplicity and convenience could cause a lot of brightness"
591,"It is allowed to go to the faculty again, but cannot schedule guidance at those times. I need physical help for some courses"
594,Graduation places do not apply to people who do their literature study. That's a bit crooked.
595,"Have to make projects or homework tasks on your own removed all motivation, and went very badly or did not happen! Because of this I dropped quite a few courses because I just didn't get anywhere with those assignments. Provide more assignments in groups !!! If you also want to test individually, do so with an oral or exam"
597,"More connection with the uni and teachers. More on the uni studying, more help with how studying etc."
600,- Nowhere being able to gain ideas for designing - difficult communication with fellow students - difficult fellow students or teachers can ask small questions - no separation between studying and leisure time
603,"The combination of the workload and Corona has ensured that my battery for studying is just a bit empty. Just a break does not feel like an option due to the student loan, but as a must. I miss the understanding of the mental health of students in Corona. I understand that they should set requirements when getting a profession, it would all be really nice if there was more room to postpone studying. Studying in a student house is just quite heavy and because of the fact that there are no nice outings or something to look forward to you get into a grind of studying. The home studying results in your room becoming your place for everything, which does not make it easy to take."
604,Limiting freedom and imposing measures that are not clear whether it will really help. My confidence in the government has fallen even further.
606,The TU expected much more from students but gave much less
607,Too few cafes with friends/fellow students. RPNOW is the worst program for exams ever.
615,"being unable to create a sense of community on TU, received little support, not really experienced diversity of education: all subjects were given the same shape, some teachers also do not seem to take the trouble to teach TU for example if possible But prefer to stay at home."
616,"In online counseling (architecture) you always had to have things ready to show. Physically on the studio, sketches are sufficient, this is much less stressful."
617,I think it is difficult to see that you are less able to feel because of certain things. And because of that you can start doubting about yourself and end up in a kind of routine. I think it is important that you are also encouraged to go out and not sit with yourself.
618,"Since the restrictions are down, Various Organizations Can Organization Social Gatherings as the batch of 2020/2021 Did not have much opportunity."
619,Watching a lecture without assignments is not motivating for me. better if I have to apply it right away
620,We were a lot of student this academic year. Many of us did not get the electives we wanted. Chosing a Course was a speed competition! I Felt the Commercial Value of my Presense to the Bone
630,"less and less motivation to do things, less social contact and more friction with housemates and friends, less well planning"
632,More connection with students and professors. Professors who also show live study -related things for the camera.
633,"Working from home is not productive, especially with more open assignments such as an article or writing a thesis, it is difficult to stay concentrated enough"
637,"I have the idea that TU Delft is not genuinely concerned with the well -being of the students. In my opinion, TU Delft is very concerned about not running up image damage. Around January of the academic year, TU Delft said that there was no room for self -study places at the university (while according to the corona measures and other universities this was possible). Only when the media found that the well -being of students did not come into action and suddenly was something possible in terms of self -study. In addition, it would be good if TU Delft and universities as a collective follow the importance of studying and college at the university more expresses, so that this is also taken into account in the Lower House."
638,"Because of the coronacrisis and the lockdowns you often have nothing to do but study. Furthermore, nothing else is open or undertaking. This often ensures long end -of -the -day days, more stress and little mental rest, especially during exams. In these periods there is often nothing else to do than blocks for the exams, this combined with the stress of Remote Proctoring exams (I do everything well, I have scanned my room well, I do not behave strangely, I may be seen as a fraudist, My exam is declared invalid etc.) ensures a restless period."
639,"Professors and other TU employees who are difficult to reach. BrightSpace is often unclear, which means that different deadlines are mixed up"
641,"I Experienced online education as Positive in the Sense: - We Could Easily Take Screenshots of Slides/Demos/Notes Written by the Teacher - It's Much Esier to Focus than We would have lectures in a big hall Like the Aula E.G. Notes would be harder as well - it takes effort to ask questions - We can decide for ourelves whether a lecture/Q & a session is horthding, if not, you can simply leave the call, thus spending time more efficiently all in all, i Hope Tu Delft Will Continuous Offering Online Sessions;)"
648,Little motivation to study.
650,My ADHD has become a worse problem and my depression has emerged and has actually become a major role and big problem in my life. I also experienced that I could no longer work in just a student room and so I moved to my parents so that I had more space and separation of half -days.
651,"I liked studying for the coronacrisis. And it takes a lot of time and energy, but if it is fun (with the whole experience of lecture banks and popping together during home lectures) then that is not a problem. During the coronacrisis the nice thing went off and I became quite unhappy. I now have to spend more time in my studies, often with less results. And that while it is not fun anymore. That is very demotivating."
655,Maybe psychological help/
657,"social isolation; Domestic emotional violence but no other place to live by the living crisis.; hopelessness; After having kept it somewhat, depressive feelings as a result"
660,"Because everything is online, breaks are usually skipped. At lectures, teachers give only a 5 -minute break and go on for too long and with meetings it is expected that you will go from one meeting to another. As a result, there is no time to process the knowledge. If the College follows the norm at home, it would be nice to get enough break."
662,mental fatigue
664,Teachers who almost ignore you because that is easy online.
665,"Discover what I find infresqnt for my graduation, I don't know which direction I want to go. Normally you come into contact with other people much more, you walk past labs and graduation spaces, you see teachers during lectures you can start a conversation without obligation."
666,"Social contact with fellow students is much less, then you sometimes feel stressed and alone and you cannot put things into perspective. Regularly accessible contact with teacher/coach is also more difficult, so they do not have a good picture of your progress. And sit behind your desk all day long."
667,"Try to give people time to create a study/life balance, Everyone is Going Full Study More and More."
668,I had contacted the study supervisors when I had been tested positively for Corona and I received no guidance at all. It would have been better if I never contacted them.
670,concentrate on working on study. Sitting at home is difficult to keep work and relaxation apart.
673,I need to stop feeling like I'm talking to a robot that striker out stock response every time I approach an administrative member of the staff.
677,"I feel very alone and find it very tiring to have to sit behind my screen all day every day. I also have the feeling that the moment you are doing badly and as a result you can no longer fully follow the study program that nobody fascinates or you want to help you even ask for help and indicate your situation. During the Coronacrisis I really got the feeling that there is no attention for the individual unless you are the best student, while it seems to me that the goal is to create a pleasant environment for as many students as possible. For me, if you ask for help several times you will not be completely ignored."
680,"I know it's complicated and that tu delft is working on it, but doing more covid-proof activities on campus would be so motivating and positive for many of us that i think it's worth making the effort to research more strategies on how to make this a reality. Studying a Master's at Tu Delft as an International Student is Already a Challenging Experience on its own, and I'm Lucky to Be Surrounded by Wonderful Friends and Flatmates, But There Are Many People in A worse Situation, Especally 1st-Year Students. All this affects our mental health and it's a challenge to keep a balance between being productive and efficient with our studies, and having a fulfilling social life. This is why I think it's very positive for many or us to have on-campus activities (Under Government RestRictions, or Course)."
681,"Please for all the international students, if you want to keep them Happy, I would appreciate at 30 percent reduction of the tuition fees. We have paid to use the facilities, get Practical Experience from Doing the Group Projects (Building Our Wing Box), Meeting People, Learning about Cultures and much more. We have missed everything and not just that, our families live far away from us so we can't visit them due to this crisis."
682,I would like it if there was free coffee in campus :)
686,"Asking help online from teachers is difficult. I also did not feel comfortable with Lesson on campus in September, with the idea that your group mate goes to illegal parties or has 20 housemates. I didn't like to expose myself to that for 1 morning physical lesson. I also had the elderly in my area .. so you want to be careful"
688,Maintain social academic contacts. Little physical contact ensures that you keep poor contact with fellow students and the size of your group of contacts is getting smaller. While this is essential for the future field.
692,"Contact with teachers. I think the workload in some departments is so high that students are put behind, I now experience mainly with my thesis. Guidance with the start of my thesis. Compared to other directions, Structural does not really dander, I find. The BrightSpace page is heavily substandard. The fact that faculties make their own regulations and seem to act independently of each other in relation to graduation presentations, study places etc. does the fact that TU Delft is one university."
696,"Teachers are difficult to understand about Zoom and their comments can therefore seem to be very negative, which reduces motivation"
697,"Normally you would immediately make friends if you started in September. I didn't know anyone in Delft at all and apart from two project groups that has not changed. At the beginning of the year I traveled up and down for the weekly project hours until the Lockdown went back in and I was at home for 5 months without being able to do anything else. When we were finally allowed to come to the campus again, the faculty also decided that it was only once every two weeks, or 3 times in the entire 4th period. Furthermore, more than 10 hours a day studying was not unusual."
699,Just one mail in a month to check on student's health is not worth it.
700,Stress on Graduating on Time and about Paying the International Fee for the Extra Months I Take For Graduating
701,For on Campus Activities Lecture Are The Most Important because It’s Getting Very Hard to Concentrate Turning Online Lectures
703,"My Strongest Need Right Now would be to socialize with people. I'm going home in a couple of week, then I'll meet my friends and it will be fine, but duration this year I've felt extremely lonely. at some point the University Established this walk with a fellow student program, which I thought was something interesting to meet new people and go outsid a bit more, but I was in a place where I could be the energy to do anything, soo I never participated in it, which made me feel just worse. Now I Feel A Bit Better, But There Were Some Really Dark Times Duration this year. Something I was really looking forward to when I enrolled in this university was participating in lectures (in presence) and meeting international students, and having those negated for a whole year really made me feel awful."
705,"Students must adhere to deadlines, but professors take all the time to assess exams. Online exams also often go wrong (from not being admitted to losing exams) with all the consequences for the students. It must also be taken into account the stress that online exams brings through everything that can go wrong."
709,I have hardly had any contact with my fellow students from the same master program. That was very unfortunate.
710,More Relaxed Social Interaction with Teachers is Difficult when I Personally Don't Want To Go to Campus Too Much (Due to the Risk of Infection). The Tutoring is nice but I miss getting to know my teachers more on a personal level.
711,"That the government often did not mention universities in press conferences, which ensured that many people around me did not see no bright spot. It is incredibly important for students to be among their fellow students at the faculty, something that I think has been constantly underexposed. In this way you give people, who, according to the government, form the new generation that will have to solve world problems, a false start. Add that to the loan system and the house shortage, and you create a generation that will have a very difficult start."
712,Online examination is unnecessarily extra stressful. The possibility that something can fall out or does crazy brings extra things to think about.
714,problem in the home situation
716,Little communication about the possibility for study places. Also little opportunity to study there more often in the week.
717,"I personally do not find the questions of the survey in the goal. I expected that I could specifically indicate which things I would like to see next year and which not. Hence this list now: - I do not appreciate hybrid education forever. I understand that this next academic year (at the beginning of the year) still has to be done, but I don't want this forever. I function much better if I get physical lessons and can talk to others. - It is awkward if you have lectures on the campus in the morning and online in the afternoon. My travel time takes longer than the break. - I felt alone. - It is nice if people are wearing their camera at a lecture. That way you still get a little contact. This could be stimulated (not forced). It is also finer for the teacher."
718,"I was not studying the moment the crisis started. As a result, I noticed that I was lagging behind fellow students when I started studying again. They were much more agile with and more used to the digital and working from home. I also felt even more invisible and only in my study process because I did not follow the regular program. The initiative must come from me if I need help or something, and I understand that, but it is quite annoying to have to ask for help every time and to ask for an exception and to have to do that yourself. If I don't do that, I will just forget. That feels annoying. It puts an extra pressure with me, while I am already disappointed that I can't just come with the rest. It would be nice if teachers or study advisers occasionally also check with the people they know they are not following the regular program whether everything is still okay. But I also know that this is much to ask, and I have to say that the teachers at my faculty are really super compassionate and easy, so if you ask, then almost everything is okay."
727,"lack of social contact No clear schedule for lectures (there is a schedule but I miss the dicipline to watch everything at that time everything is being recorded) Lectures OPNEME itself is not the problem, if lecture is recorded but I can physically go to college do I always."
734,"I have a lot of trouble studying outside the campus, studying on campus, with fellow students helps enormously to maintain my motivation. Just studying is mentally very tiring."
738,Had little to no opportunities to get to know my fellow master students. Because of this I do not feel connected to my fellow students from the Master. This while I experienced this feeling during my bachelor very much.
741,"The feeling that you have to go after things is much bigger than when it was all physical. Sometimes you overlook things that you normally had not overlooked, because you were already there. So catching up moments are sometimes not taken into account online. Furthermore, talking a lot and studying outdoors helps to have a feeling that you are still among the students."
743,Making contact with fellow students was difficult in the first period and finding the right way to study and exchange study methods were difficult
745,Loneliness no motivation just studying/no social activities online lesson is not nice
748,"Less contact with fellow students, fewer busy days: feeling that I don't get out of my time what I would like"
750,"The coronacrisis does not only cause problems. For students who do not live in Delft, it is pleasant not to have to go to the campus for an activity that can easily be organized online."
751,"Personally, I sometimes had the feeling that some profesors simply had no respect for the students. This was mainly because they didn't want to make any effort to give our live lectures (yes I know that the priority of lectures are also relatively okay but the interaction is completely gone), then you will get a voice in mind that says; If they don't want to make any effort for us why would I make an effort for them and I don't mean studying the material because that should happen but especially it again at weird times the agenda to make the agenda in that one question time in the can be two weeks. Everyone has to adapt in this weird situation, but sometimes I have the idea that we as students are simply being put aside. I am not going to say what professor it was but I had a profession last semseter where all the college had been adopted and there was a questions hour once every 2 weeks for the 120 students who followed that course that was far too little, it was also that emails With questions also not answered properly, so that no interaction with the professor was possible at all. That then while it normally gives college for this course 6-8 hours a week and now apparently did not think it was worth releasing the same time a week for us."
755,"Group work was difficult because I did not know the others and there was no mandatory hour that you had to work on. Furthermore, if I started to run a bit for 1 box because I was sick or just had no energy for 1 day, it was very difficult to pick up the thread again, especially due to mental reason, from shit I walk behind and then every time you Will catch up getting a panicky feeling. It also does not help that I know none of the training, from the second or third year, and it feels like I can't talk about anything about box. 1 box that it was very good to me, was Numeric Mathematics Practicum who had fixed questions mornings/afternoon via Jitsi. That was very helpful."
756,"That a lot has to come from yourself. Going to work, staying motivated, persevering. Normally you pull each other through that."
757,"If you remotely cared about the mental health of students there are so many things you could do. The student counselors are a joke, a lot of people with health problems don't know that they can get help (extra time on exams, help with tuition, etc) you don't care to inform them. year after year students fill in the course evaluation forms giving valid criticism to pros and courses and they are consistently ignored. You know exactly which Courses/Study Programs are way too much for the credits givven and yet each year you do nothing. With covid you basically told students 'sucks to be you' and provid no help or allowances whatsoever."
758,Almost all of my friends at the TU seemed to be allowed to go to the campus for education or in an adapted manner at some times. This was not allowed to do this very specifically my volume of my studies. Because of this I felt undervalued and less motivated.
766,More Social Engagement from the faculty Maybe. In A Physical Capacity Especally Along with the Students Who Haven’t Been To The Faculty For Over A Year.
767,"I think, (which does not apply to me), that the alone (and certainly foreign) student had a hard time this time. I think involving these people, by organizing,, among other things, events, is very important."
768,"Lots of concentration, sleeping problems and feeling of time completely lost. (cause by having to do everything in the same loft, instead of a different location for lectures). no more rest"
771,Distraction during online lectures and the proliferation of platforms for online lectures and in particular exams. Clarity in particular online exams would be very nice
772,I would like it to be easier to get a workplace at the university.
777,It would be nice if the university Considers The Financial Precarity of International Students in The Current Situation.
778,"Start studying and continuing to study. At the start of the Corona this was still possible, but last semester I could no longer get to work, or if I started I quickly became distracted. Staring outside and doing nothing became more interesting than studying."
780,Too little contact with fellow students to be able to study together (even though I have personal contact with them) much more difficulty with online lectures than offline. I do not understand it less quickly and remember it less well (in addition to finding motivation to follow them).
781,"Little opportunity to work at TU Delft, no variety outside of study"
782,"I Feel very neglected bee an international student here. Be it the heavy tuition fees we pay or what opportunities we get, I always feel we are never considered while making decisions. I will have to always be for help just because we do not belong to this place. I Strongly Feel That Tu Delft is not a great place for an international student to be here. We pay so much but we get very little in return"
784,Phpaps it would be nice if the university could hold more sort of social events or have more project based classes.
786,"Halfway through my first master year the coronacrisis started. As a result, I lost contact with people from my master who I had just got to know, so that I actually don't know any of my master. There was a lot of attention for first-year bachelor's and master's students to get to know each other at the start of this academic year (very logical and rightly so!), But senior students still had fewer options for that. My motivation was mainly removed because every day I was in my room all day to study, relax, sleep and eat. Later when study places were released at the TU, that really got better. And finally I also suffered from few social contacts. I liked online drinks or coffee breaks in the beginning, but soon one thing I 'had to do' than I really wanted it. As a result, I really saw much less different people and I came into a rut in which I couldn't study well either."
788,"Before my internship Ben came through a professor of TU Delft at a company (EYA Solutions) that exploited students and used them as free employees in which they saw more than 40-hour working weeks such as normal and forced students with fraud and lies to do multi-year projects As graduation projects while there is only a few months in front of this. After having raised this at my faculty (BME) and have provided evidence that this had already happened to at least 12 other students, they decided to continue to work with this company and clearly show that the experience of their students is not makes up. I find this outrageous from TU Delft and has harmed their image with me and the other 12 students."
790,Could you Provide Both Online and Offline Education Solutions?
795,"Procedure during exams. This was and still has been a gross violation of my privacy in my opinion. I felt driven in a corner. My opposition was also ignored/rejected as an individual student. Because the motto was, if you don't accept what we want from you, we would like to see you again next year. I also want to add if the TU cannot agree with this statement. I also found it fairly outrageous to put certain responsibilities to the student. This is mainly aimed at the sanctions that would be affected if your internet connection suddenly ends. Fortunately this did not happen to me. But this has delivered a lot of stress, since the factor is influenced by largely exterene influences (e.g. living in a student flat of 15 high, +/- 400 to 500 people) that I can do relatively little about. For me, this showed that the measures that the TU has taken were not taken into account with the right to privacy, but more focused on functionality. My advice would therefore be to take into account the rights and values ​​of society and both the student in these types of measures."
797,"It is very difficult to see that working people have a lot of opportunity to go to the office and have a separate office available at home, while students have none of these options."
799,loneliness
800,loneliness. The feeling that I don't belong at the TU. The fact that I don't know my professors. The feeling that you are very much left to your fate. But this is also because I did not do my bachelor at the TU. Stress during exams whether my internet would be good enough or whether the neighbors would drill again. Uncertainty and loneliness about my choice for abroad/Master Electives and being difficult to talk to other students about it because you don't see them in real life.
804,"Because I started in the Corona year, there is almost no contact between me and fellow students. At the moment it is starting to live a bit with the people I already knew before the training. Working with fellow students is almost quiet, without the consultation it is extremely difficult to bring products to a higher level. The feedback from the teachers is often moderate, this is not due to them, but I do not feel that it helps me to set up a complete end product. I don't hear that much so I assume that things are going well, but with the deadlines in sight I don't know if this is still going. The priority of the training is also rapidly declining, after I have almost been in a meltdown halfway and I also took a few days off on the recommendation of the doctor, it becomes more difficult to worry about school when my mental health here is the Dupe can be. I have already signed up for the Psychologist students in mid -April, but the waiting time of this is until the summer .. I think vacation and free time is the thing I need now, and will probably feel less for this then to start."
807,"Burn out, how later? (with me many other students)"
808,The other interpretations of fellow students and housemates regarding the coronar rules make collaboration/his/life very complicated
810,"loneliness, lack of motivation"
811,"I found it very difficult to concentrate. Many teachers let go of permanent college moments and posted videos on BrightSpace. I would find it very valuable if there were many more fixed times a week, so that I have more structure and hold I have my routine. In addition, a lot of teachers left the possibilities of online education, because it gives limitations but also new tools. A lot of teachers could do more with this to make education more active."
812,Working from home is not always productive. Can not easily show or consult your results. Less contact with fellow students. Less easy contact with professors or employees to ask questions.
813,"Many lectures have been converted to watching video lectures from one or two years ago. As a result, the Semilive contact that you have with teachers (and students in the group app) is a bit more away. In addition, watching videos is demotivating than lectures at set times. If you don't watch that video college, I feel that it has fewer consequences than a live online college, so you postpone it earlier."
814,"- Nothing fun to look forward to - no social interaction except housemates - especially in winter suffering from negative thoughts no sense to be with people - studying at home often did not work well - often experiences online exams as extremely stressful and therefore often not also not Made well / not the feeling that I could have someone about it or that there were something of compensations (explaining home situation, for example, a lot of sound at home so that I never had good concentration etc ..) - finally. Not the feeling from the TU that they have done their best to do something for students from the moment Corona broke out. Now of course, but think it took too long. And organizing such a wellness week felt a bit crooked and not genuinely from the TU."
818,A long term psychotherapist.
820,"I felt very unsafe during the mandatory physical presence. Teachers and students did not comply with the measures and in the studios no one was responsible for checking this. I was obliged to collaborate with people who tested positive a week later. TU Delft has a duty to offer safe education and this duty has not fulfilled. After raising this with the teachers, I received a negative assessment that could not be substantiated. I am very shocked and therefore I decided to look for another university for my master."
821,"Following online lessons became very tiring after a few months. Because there was no variety in how we followed, I didn't feel a student and it was sometimes very difficult to be able to focus well on school work."
826,"Not being able to do fun things like eating out, going to the movies, parties and not being able to study at the TU every day."
830,"1. Workplace too small and not workable 2. No perspective, nothing to do 3. Evening clock 4. Only what was possible was studying 5. Insufficient attention, no understanding of and for students 6. No sport 7. Losing friends"
832,"Disappointment in the fact that the TU believes in the core that mental health is something that students should take care of themselves. In contrast to schools or companies, where teachers or managers engage the right psychologists, it is so that students just fall in between. Nobody actually pay attention to them, you will have to go to the study advisor yourself, and he will then not take the lead. You will have to arrange everything yourself. It is not seen as the responsibility of the TU to ensure that students are mentally healthy, but why?"
833,I think that thesis students should be offered more opportunities on campus.
834,Occasionally it is a pity that you meet so few people of the opposite sex. That ensured that I was occasionally a little inspiration -free.
836,"Mainly contact with professors, my supervisor specifically. By working from home it is impossible to walk by. Because of this you are often stuck with a problem for a longer period of time because contact goes slowly via e -mail."
838,"I Feel Like Filling Out This Surveys Don't Help. I'd Like To See Some Results, Like Averages How the Others Feel (If It is in Total Negative, Some Tips As Follow Up etc)"
839,"The unmotivated teachers. If every course had taken the trouble to give live lectures, I would have had much less trouble motivating myself to follow courses."
841,"As menttioned in Previous Question, I would like to be vaccinated asap. Maybe I Should Ask for Local Municipality by Myself."
842,after
843,"Provide more education at the Faculty. The possibility is there, but our teachers are not obliged to be present. I notice that they continue to zoom, that is their right. But I notice that I am completely done with online education and I think it is a shame that some teachers get rid of everything so easily. For example, I now have a profession where our introduction lectures were not even live. I don't think this is a good start to a new profession, it unfortunately feels a lot of unmotivating for me."
844,"It is very difficult to ask questions to teachers, they are often not available via e -mail, and the BrightSpace discussion platform is not responded to."
845,"Uncertainty from the faculty with regard to courses, projects and exams. Communication was often not enough to give a sense of control with us."
846,"Expand the pressure to do things with friends again, now that everything opens up again with increasing study pressure is not ideal"
849,"Because of Corona I have sustained a study delay, this year I finish my bachelor, I just don't know if I want to start my master if I haven't completed my bachelor yet"
851,The need to see people was very high. Sitting in your small room behind a screen all day is far from optimal.
854,Lack of stimuli and social contact. and over -stimulation and fatigue by starting social life
858,"Very bad study facilities. Is better now. I find it difficult to understand that buildings are completely empty (still) to take the certain for the uncertainty. In that respect, TU Delft, in my opinion, has fallen enormously short (and still). The biggest loss is among the students (especially other graduates) because the graduation process in itself is incredibly lonely (no group work, project groups, lectures, etc.)."
860,My Duwo Housing Contract is ending in the last week of July and it is really tough to find a place for just a couple of months after that. I am planning to graduate in August but finding a place to live could have an effect on that.
862,"I Feel Like the Amount of Actual teaching the Lectures is very low. Students Need to Do Most of the Work Themselves, And This is very frustrating, Especial Considering That Some Lecturers Don't Do Much to Help Ease US Into Their Courses. Learning here Feels More Like Cramming Lattely, Because of the Amount and Difficulty of Information. These Sorts of Learning Regimes Don't Aid in Creating Deep Thinking Minds, IT Only AIDS in Creating Robots That Learn Concepts by Heart, Without Actual Understanding Anything."
865,"The lack of a social faculty environment. I am a first -year Master student and I hardly know any of my year, because I simply never see or talk to them"
870,studying is spicy boring on your own
877,Live Lectures on Campus Exams Please Open Up Campus !!!!!!!!!
879,"Distance education ensures less contact between students, and you are quickly distracted."
880,I Don't Know
886,"With some courses I wonder if I have understood the base well, and I am afraid of courses that still have to come"
891,"I would like the university, for example, to open the bars again, because this is allowed again"
892,"Loneliness, little self -evident contact with other students and supervisors during graduation, or when all that is not possible. It does not feel like there is interest from the TU in my emotional condition and it takes a lot of time to get in touch with people who can help, both inside and outside the TU."
900,"Studying difficult at home in a whole year is the only thing the students of TU Delft have received a lot of candles through the letterbox, that is what we have received for thousands of euros in tuition fees"
901,The lesser/few contact with fellow students because you are not next to each other and do not walk through the corridors but only sits at home.
908,Break out rooms during lectures are not ideal. This could be solved with short assignments in preparation or afterwards to a college that you have to make with 2 to 3 people.
912,"being able to work physically in project groups is nice, but having digital agreements (eg with teachers, or simply within project groups) is also good and sometimes more convenient. Physically lectures ensure that you better keep your concentration there; But the advantage of following Home College is also that at a boring lecture, or with dust you already know, you can easily do something else."
913,Little flexibility around problems with exams. (almost) no 1 on 1 contact with teachers
915,There is no cohesion between the students in general and no connections between teachers and students. This makes it seem like we've been watching YouTube videos for a year and a half without any form of interaction.
921,"Little study of help. For questions you have to send an email to which you sometimes get an answer. The coronacrisis has been difficult for everyone. The university has adhered to all agreements and there is little improvement in this. The difficult choices made in terms of (deteriorated) education have been made to get out of this crisis as quickly as possible. As far as I'm concerned, TU Delft has acted well."
923,"find it difficult that a certain teacher did not delve into finding out how you can make beautiful notes in an online environment. This teacher uses his mouse, making it of course unreadable. I find it difficult to stay motivated if your teacher is not. I wonder if the teachers are being properly guided."
924,Comolications of group work through only online communication more difficult private and study to separate monotonous daily schedule at Weining social stimulation
929,There was no neutral place to meet during Corona with study friends to work and have fun. Making new friends is difficult. Balance between study and private life was a lot harder to find
930,Education is of low quality
931,"I have no friends and I have hardly been able to make new friends, so I feel lonely and have no one to talk to."
932,no concentration and quickly distracted
933,"I Just Wish There Were Better Communities in Delft, I am Often Feeling Lonely, and the Study Does Not Really Promote Social Interaction Either."
936,"Finding graduation counselors could not be done and had a major negative influence for my mental condition. When the lockdown was at its height point, I was disappointed daily for 1.5 months by an empty mailbox. Within that time I sent dozens of emails. Usually only 1.5 weeks (after having sent another reminder) I only received an answer (almost always a rejection). That I knew fewer teachers because I had done my bachelor somewhere else, it didn't make it easier."
937,The fact that things were not communicated enough with students on time and therefore caused much uncertainty. The problems with online exams/proctoring were also very stressful
938,Little to no study places
939,Little contact with fellow students and therefore little 'random' inspiration or motivation for graduation. Graduating during Corona is very lonely because you work all alone and you really have to keep yourself at work.
949,"Without getting to know anyone starting your master, a lot of lack of social contact and lack of motivation of always sitting in the same place."
950,"I tried to push myself to move more and go out more while working from home, but this was sometimes difficult due to the amount of zoomcalls. Perhaps something can be thought of that encourages students to get up and move a little more, because this often does not come to mind. Moving throughout the day is something we did a lot at first, you had to walk from place to place and cycle. Now everything is behind your laptop. Moving is good for your brain, your creativity and your overall well -being. That is why I think this could help if people feel lifeless/slow/unproductive by sitting behind their laptop all day and sitting in Zoommeetings."
951,Less effectively learned by not being able to discuss the substance aloud with fellow students.
952,Loneliness stress less control over emotions tired hopeless
955,"Reserving a study place at the TU was very limited and had to go far ahead. Using a study place was intended for if you could not work at home, but you don't know that a (half) week ahead. Completely switching to digital colleges removes a lot of togetherness and motivation. And not being able to study at another faculty takes the opportunity to study with housemates or friends at other faculties."
957,"Concentration of problems, lack of social interaction, poor quality education"
961,The group works gave birth very badly. Many students do not communicate with each other and work behind their computer without consulting fellow students. Very unfortunate because the quality of the projects is declining
964,"As a Student Who Wants To Do A Masters Program at Another University, I Find the Lack of Resources to Switch Studies at the TU Delft Worrying. Study Councilors and Administrative Personel Are Not Able To Give Proper Advice, and Give Contradictory Statements, which have caused me a lot of Issues"
965,I already liked recorded lectures online in advance. Then I can see for myself when that comes out and the break and back buttons are very handy. think that they work much more effectively compared to old form lectures
967,Social study contact and being able to spar on topics. Not studying next to my bed. I can close the day poorly because there is no physical difference between the places where I work and relax
968,loneliness. (especially for a foreign student or a refugee student)
969,Yes everything around Ewi is a gang (not only literally but also the whole situation). I don't understand how this building can cause so much misery and it seems good if management once keeps an evaluation and perhaps some system engineers involves.
971,A feeling that the TU understands that it is incredibly difficult for us to find some distraction in addition to searching and worrying to complete everyone's health a full -time study
973,Hardly any initiative from the university or study program to make contact among fellow students. I would like to meet people but have not been knowing for a whole year.
974,"Lack of Study Place, Lack of Support from TU No Compensation for Not Being Able to Go to Practicals or Making Use of the Facilities That I Paid for"
975,Contact with supervisors during large projects is very difficult if everything goes through Zoom and mail. This makes it very difficult to do a large project that you do on your own. This makes getting feedback and discussing the project difficult.
976,"severe mental problems, walking out of graduation, further graduating without a client, a graduationchair that the TU left"
983,I personally don't like the fact that you need to buy the book for certain courses (thermodynamics).
984,International Students Don't know when they will get a vaccine.
986,"No, thanks."
987,"After doing everything online for more than a year, I really feel my motivation plummet. It is difficult if the same routine is sitting behind your desk every day and working until the day is over. If you go to the campus it feels very different. In addition, Professor student interaction is very low, and that is not directly due to the professors but more to the design. Personally, I find it difficult during DSE to find the balance. After doing DSE all day, you are just completely empty and you no longer have the motivation to do something useful, sometimes no more energy to do groceries or cook. This makes it difficult to eat healthily and also difficult to keep your room and yourself tidy and clean and that in turn ensures that you have even less motivation. It remains a kind of downward spiral and if it is really too bad, you do something again, but then it just starts again. And I am pretty sure that there are people who find it much more difficult to get out of such a spiral. Furthermore, I am not sure what the university can do about it. But these are my problems of recent times."
988,What I miss the most on days when studying is going to go to the UB spontaneously and to be able to sit there with friends. Reserving now means that it is often not possible to see the day for yourself whether I want to go to the UB.
992,"Studying becomes a bit of a rut, and it is difficult to study together with fellow students"
993,The threshold became very high for me to ask for help from teachers about the curriculum. Normally I do that during the college's break.
994,"Insulated feeling in my room, sometimes the idea that I am alone. That is why I thought it was a shame that the ON6 profession did not give a joint opening but that all lectures were included in advance. When it is live it has more a sense of community"
995,Studying at home is just not fun. I am barely motivated to sit on my studies and therefore I also have much less pleasure in my studies.
997,I missed contact with fellow students. Especially in the second year in which you only do an internship and your thesis. This can best be remedied with study places where you can work and consult together. Meetings organized by the university were fun but was less effective/natural.
1002,Concentration and motivation problems during online colleges.
1004,"Not building ties with fellow students and teachers causes problems because you can't find any understanding with study-related problems (you normally find this at fellow students, but you don't see them now) and not building a bond with teachers is problematic Now that I am looking for a graduation research, but actually have no idea who my teachers are, what they do and how I can best approach them."
1005,"enormous pressure on the students (at least Architecture, ON6). Teachers only increase this pressure more. not well -coordinated grilles. Few free evenings or weekend days. A lot of negativity. stress."
1007,My main problem is that I found it difficult to really make friendships with fellow students and to speak more often than just during working groups or hours that we were allowed to be at the faculty.
1008,"A lack of understanding for each other between students, teachers and the management of the Faculty/TU Delft."
1009,"Few coffee moments with fellow graduates / phders / professors to discuss short things, which means that you will come to a solution less often."
1012,motivation problems because I was in my room all day and could do almost nothing outside
1013,"Applying structure in a day of studying is and remains extremely difficult (that will not get better, not even after a year). I miss my fellow students enormously, both academic (being able to consult/spar about teaching materials) and social. I hope that next year you can really go back to normal, even though that means regularly testing. Testing before you can go to college, pub or party is acceptable."
1014,The communication was very bad in order. I heard much clearer messages from friends at other universities. Here at the TU that was very poorly arranged. I didn't have a good idea what to expect. This is still the case about the situation of the EWI faculty.
1015,Lack of real connection between students and between students and teachers; Lack of occasions on which you could relax.
1016,"The reach via e-mail from some teachers is dramatic. A search for a graduation assignment at this time is very difficult, since walking a teacher is not possible. If there is no response to e-mails, this will take a long time."
1017,I have an ADHD and dyslection and I sometimes notice that this makes me perform worse than I could. For the Corona Crisis I thought the guidance about functional restrictions was already bad and I don't think this has improved. I would really appreciate it if more of students with a function limitation is looked at because it sometimes feels a bit like we are a forgotten group
1018,"In this no survey there was no possibility to indicate which parts of hybrid education should remain and which not, right? I would like to keep the opportunity to attend lectures online, go to university if I want to and follow all group projects as physically as possible. Specific problems were loneliness, extra stress through online exams and due to other technical problems, planning problems due to a lack of compulsory parts. This year I really did and worked a lot on my own, since I don't live in Delft either. That was sometimes quite heavy."
1021,"The communication occasionally suffers from the coronac crisis, so it is not always clear."
1022,"I really hope that this hybrid learning can continuous and that I can finish my master's degree While Being in my home country. Personally, I would be ok with traveling to delft for the exams, but I really hope that the lectures will be continued to be recorded next year as well."
1025,"Because you have little face-to-face contact with fellow students and supervisors, it is very easy to become unseen unmotivated and let your progress relax."
1026,"Many of my friends are abroad, so it is impossible to see them, even if that could be done with vaccinations etc. And I am such a person who would rather not meet too often before I have received a vaccination."
1029,money problems
1030,"Very little contact with others and not knowing where you can ask for help/the step is too big. A lot is already being done about it, but remains difficult. Recently I also have a lot of days of days that are the same every day and stay stuck in it. More variety is needed/desired."
1034,Money
1035,"I entered in February, I had to arrange everything myself. Nobody cared about me."
1036,I have experienced racism against our asian people many times in Delft.
1037,"Human interaction is what normally keeps me motivated, invested and happy. For me, the lack of this was the biggest problem in the past year and a half and the main cause of my other problems. Online or forced contact does not work for me."
1040,"I think it is absolutely unnecessary to still have to take online exams. I have not been in the main building of the faculty for other six months and I feel that I am losing a lot of motivation with this. Is it really impossible to have a minimum physical lesson? Sitting in front of your computer screen for 8 hours a day can no longer be an option on this point. I understand that this is not a choice of TU Delft. What I am very dissatisfied with is that after other six months of making efforts, TU Delft has decided to simply cancel the only academic prospects of many students (minor abroad). I went to a country where Covid is no longer a problem and I have been vaccinated. But the TU still had to cancel it without mercy and that just feels like a slap in the face of the hard -working student. I blame this since this decision is at the TU. The university has taken the patience of the student and I expected more effort or compensation in that area."
1043,Longer Summer Break
1045,"- Loneliness (at Les op Zoom you have no conversations with each other in between, as in real life. It is difficult at Zoom lessons to really get in touch with your fellow students)"
1046,"Physical contact is really much better than online contact and all exams and lectures were arranged differently so a standard for this would be nice. So preferably Bongo for Colleges, Proctored Exams via RPNOW and a similar time on exams (so for a 3 -hour max 4.5 hour in assignments) and an hour later Oral Verification (instead of a week later)"
1047,I think a separation between private and study is the most important because you are so mentally much healthier. A separate study place outside the house is actually a requirement for that.
1049,Studying indoors all day without contact with fellow students and/or friends of large student houses given risk
1050,Less social outings with friends
1052,Nothing Special
1053,"No lecture or accessible way that you could learn about gloom: what it is, what the symptoms are, how you can best remedy (without a psychologist since the waiting times are very long), what you can expect in that process (recovering of gloom) And how you should go with that."
1054,No
1056,"Connection, sports and cosiness. Anyway, everyone will probably say this. Suddenly I noticed how nice it is to just see all your friends at the TU"
1057,I think it is extremely important for everyone that everyone can study as much as possible on campus. There must be even more focus on this.
1058,"I feel that I am no longer part of student life. It is important for me to have a clear separation between studying and my life. In addition, I get out of my words badly through a screen and I find it difficult to discuss my work."
1059,"I have missed the lack of random contact with fellow students in particular, but I think this is difficult to be solved by the TU."
1060,"concentration, motivation, being in the same room for too long, missing the atmosphere in IO"
1061,"Nothing for the Moment, I Think Everything Has Been Talked About About"
1064,"I don't meet new people, I don't get out of the house for a week."
1065,"Stress, the feeling that I have many responsibilities that I get less due to a lack of motivation, a lot of social pressure because you still want to see everyone but I am small groups that are full every evening with an appointment with 1 person instead of a few evenings with a group"
1066,private time and school time ratio is a bit difficult
1067,"The only problem I actually had was just sitting at home. Is fun for a week, but after that it becomes boring and antisocial."
1070,Just the need of having to go somewhere everyday
1071,The New Exam Registration Rules Harm Students.
1072,"Too short of interaction with fellow students, vague planning when it comes to whether or not may be present. Too many different comunication platforms. (Before my brusje it was difficult to comunicate with some professors and the problem of no answers played sheet more a role because it was difficult to comic by students among themselves"
1073,Just studying is a lot harder. Motivating yourself to study is difficult. Especially if you have to in the same place where you sleep
1075,Little social input and making contact with others is difficult and exciting. You don't know very well whether others already know each other or are in the same boat. It is difficult to estimate how others are doing and how others think things are going with you.
1078,The most difficult thing is no longer easy to meet your fellow students and thereby study / being together. Working together remotely remains a challenge.
1081,Tiring online meetings
1085,NAH
1086,Poor sleep rhythm
1087,Studying at home and lack of empathy from the TU
1088,No
1089,motivationless and friendly
1091,"Focus concentration. Keep an overview, often because it is no longer possible through contact at the university, which of course turns out to be for me. Now it is to find everything yourself, which is logically to do, but not of course for me"
1093,Combine everything above. Study together = Faster/better understand = achieving a better result together
1094,Very poor communication between student and professors. I do not feel that the interests of the student are discussed.
1096,Nothing
1098,received little of what was smashed in the field
1099,Nothing
1100,The past year have leg tough aspecyly for International Students. I Feel Like We have not leg treated fairly and this has caused a high possibility of delay in our studies. 90 percent of the people I know are not graduating on time. There are many factors that the tu are just not consulting from the point of view of the international students. So Please Reduce the Tuition for International Students and Let Us Stress Less
1101,High workload without distraction
1103,"- see few friends
 -Weig fellow students
 -Weig social interaction"
1105,More real-life interactions with people and to do that more on-campus education needs to be implemented soon.
1107,Fewer options for losing accumulated stress with hobbies. Increased social fear due to less contact with other people
1108,"UB Studying is now partially back, but that would have been possible before I am concerned and the offer is still not very extensive"
1110,Loneliness / Motivation Problems / Uncertainty / Randomness of Approach subjects in the crisis / Breaking of student days
1111,"Poor sleep, concentration level drops, giving up is easier"
1112,"As a first year student I will really like to have a clean introduction week Since I Didn't Have the Chance to That The Previous Year! I really because to meet new people, party and have some fun before another exhausting academic year inkins."
1113,"Please try to find other ways to avoid fraud in exams, not just make the exams so hard and add many questions in exams."
1115,"In my home workroom there is never really rest because of the amount of sound in and around my house, and through single glass it was cold in the winter and now too hot. Due to the coronacrisis there were fewer people to find internship/graduation places at companies, they are now there again, but for me too late. In the end there was a physical graduation agency for me at the faculty, but the first month I had to work from home and that was very tough."
1116,Just sitting at home all day had very bad effects on me. I only dreamed about study. Lack of relaxation made me overworked.
1117,"Loss of the internet connection, the lack of social contacts, a lower motivation, more intrinsic motivation required by less social control"
1118,all your life happened in a room
1119,"The problem that is insoluble is the lack of physical interaction and the screen time that it entails. Personally, I find nothing as tiring as being behind a laptop 8 hours a day, in an environment that is not well arranged for that. This causes mental powers due to the lack of communication with loved ones and physical complaints due to a non -ergonomic attitude."
1120,thank you
1121,Little social contact. Sometimes forget to go outside. Did not enjoy a good relationship with study. Afraid to ask questions because of the lack of contact with fellow students and lecturers. Always have the feeling that you have to study so that relaxation is not relaxing
1123,The Tuition Fees Should Be Reduced Duration the Corona Crisis.
1125,no
1128,Reduce the International Tuition Fees For Next Year and Provide More Counselors That We Can Talk To.
1130,Teachers communication via the online platform can be better. Some teachers did not think along with the fatigue of the whole day behind your screen.
1132,I do my thesis at a company and I had a lot of trouble working there because of the online situation
1133,I Feel the University Should Take Time to Understand The Stress Levels Of Students And Take Necessary Actions to Prevent It.
1134,No comment
1136,N / A
1137,Just Want on-campus Education
1138,No daytime activities outside the door and no bond with the university
1139,It would be nice to know that the answers of this questionnaire are being read and not just bee plotted by the scores.
1140,I Don't Know
1141,I fear that only 'semi' mandatory education (on certain days) can re -establish social academic cohesion. If it is too non -binding or there are too many obstacles then it is very difficult to create this. The creative process of discussion cannot be placed in fixed jobs and will therefore only be able to return in one way. Without this process you can hardly call yourself a pride in engineer.
1144,Not other than what I filled out in this form!
1146,nope
1147,No this is all!
1148,I had little motivation through studying at home a lot
1149,no needs
1150,Communicating especially over a longer period only digital is really very tiring. I often have trouble keeping my attention if meetings are longer than 1 or 2 hours
1151,skip
1155,Not really
1156,"Due to the lack of contact with fellow students, it is difficult to talk about personal problems and study-related struggles"
1157,"Working together via Zoom is sometimes difficult, certainly to motivate each other"
1158,no
1160,Difficult to motivate yourself if you can only sit in your room
1162,"I missed the making together, so it mainly felt that I had to do everything alone"
1163,"Family drama, problems with focusing, product division is very low, I am ignored by my studies on advisers."
1165,Anxiety disorder developed.
1167,"Concentration problems, not being able to ask questions, feels like LR is not fascinating who you are"
1168,no
1169,Handing in the wrong file with a digital exam was a low point 🙃
1171,No
1172,"My Master is an EU Master, and during Corona Time I only followed courses abroad, so I don't know what it's like here, but I thought the Uni's could outsource a little more money for good equipment for professors so that they have their lessons could give well. By this I mean, for example, a microphone or a tablet to be able to write. It would also have been nice if some sort of deal had been closed with a company that supplies workplace supplies so that students could set up an ergonomic workplace at a discount. Furthermore, I am very satisfied with the rapid tests that we now receive for free. That also makes social life a little more fun."
1176,skip
1177,"I think's nice that you are doing this, but to me I think my well being is relationship to my future job expectations and what I have not achieved or able to do me. Yet, I hope it Helps to Future Students :)"
1178,no
1179,Visiting Research Groups for Master Thesis Project Orientation was not really Possible.
1181,"Online education has a bad influence on my study results. Where I achieved most 55/60 out of 60 points for Corona, there are now 40/60"
1182,"The drastic reduction of social contact, both during and outside study hours, has ensured that I have little energy and quickly get exhausted from social contact that I do have now more is allowed again"
1184,My supervisors did not know me at all when I studied at home and I didn't. That led to a lot of mass communication. I also miss it very much to study with fellow students who are not necessarily my friends. There are a lot of nice fellow students that I will never speak again
1185,I have nothing to add.
1186,"Having no study place that the same amount is expected of me while I am doing little at the moment, the stress, and not having no structure"
1188,- Being unable to get in touch with professors that you are dependent on to be able to graduate. - Graduation date that is moved non stop.
1189,"0 Contact with fellow students. As third -year -olds who still have to follow 2nd -year courses, I often felt uncomfortable to add online to a company of younger -year students. Everything was recorded and that made it easy to skip and leave all the work before the end of the period (completely own fault) but still happened. I firmly believe that weekly test moments that oblige you to go through the material and count (little every time) will have a very good influence on planning and continuing to follow any hybrid form"
1190,"Not being able to watch with other groups, little exercise"
1191,"After several signals from the news, I want to see for upcoming years of study that the university is doing more about (sexual/sexist) behavior"
1192,That I have completely lost my motivation for my studies and graduation.
1193,"Colleges via Zoom works poorly in terms of concentration. Furthermore, projects are difficult to do through Zoom if fellow students are not motivated"
1194,Studying home is mentally difficult to keep study and private life separate. This makes it often difficult to focus at home
1195,That the TU takes the last bit of fun of the students for inexplicable reasons.
1196,- A broken camera of my laptop so that I could not turn it on at Zoommeetings. - boredom
1197,It is very difficult to deal with that others are allowed to meet every week while I am not allowed to. I feel that the well -being of others is more important than my well -being.
1199,No
1201,Please Provide Quality Training for Online Education Mandatorilly to All Professors.
1202,"Concentration problems, felt alone and bleakly, have been demotivated/have had, depressive symptoms, study backlog nevertheless I had already received a BSA delay"
1203,"As an international, the financial pressure I am under is truly unbearable, I have also my student job at the university, the tuition fees are exorbitant and the economic situation in my home country is really bad so no longer relay on my parents For Support, and I am Already Delayed in My Studies"
1204,"Loneliness due to lack of contact with fellow students and friends. Also due to a lack of social activities. Lack of qan energy and motivation and concentration due to loneliness and boring life at home. Studying in a student room is not a solution. This succeeds a necky time as an addition input, but only at external locations there is productivity, together with fellow students."
1205,"Sad because of the situation, want to go to the faculty, not all the time people only see on screen, whole social life upside down, no more rhythm in terms of study and sport, annoying situations with people who take Corona less seriously, or more serious, doubt about 'Risks' that you take to see people"
1206,No
1207,"I was in group projects with all fellow students who still lived with their parents at home and I in Delft, so I could not easily meet them physically."
1208,No
1210,More Study Spaces on Campus
1212,"Stress, delayed reactions professors, difficult exams, varying understanding and compassion, high workload"
1215,"The possibility to talk to a psychologist (I didn't even try it, heard that the waiting time is 8 weeks).
 Better exams - there was so much hassle with online proctoring, too long exams, canceled exams, fraud suspects etc ... Why are students not just trusted? Without that trust you can also simply copy at OP."
1216,Little social contact with fellow students.
1217,"Seen few people, even if you take exams in large halls."
1219,skip
1220,Therapy Sessions should be Almost Mandatory and Provided to Everyone.
1222,no
1223,"Everything has a registration obligation that gives a lot of (unnecessary) stress and microm management. Just walk to the UB, spontaneously agree that I miss the most"
1227,"Since March 2020 I have been on campus for 4 hours, I have practically no contact with fellow students. This is very bad for my motivation, because I see no reason for which I am still doing it"
1231,There was no TA at the home college
1232,no
1233,"As mentioned earlier, working and relaxing in the same place is extremely difficult, because with one activity you constantly think of the other. In addition, a huge lack of being outside and sport has been a damper for the physical condition, which in turn handed out a blow to my mental health. Moreover, being unable to see the friends and family that I care has been very difficult, especially because those social contacts for my mental condition are normally very good. That they were missing in the last year and a half made everything much more difficult"
1234,- Little motivation because you are at home all the time
1237,no
1239,Nothing That Hasn't Been Mentioned In The Previous Answers
1241,"I miss the possibility of discussing how the college was, and for group work to talk together, I miss a lot. In my opinion, studying is more than just the content of courses, but not now."
1243,"Sitting alone at home. Exercising on X was not possible for a long time, this also made that period very difficult. I think a lot of students are really happy that the gym and outdoor sports can be done again. I know you can study on civil, but it is not obvious that this has been made possible for everyone. A lot of uncertainty about what is possible and what is not. In addition, this is different per faculty is also a bit separate. To organize an event for all students and to get them moving, it would be very nice if, for example, a running competition was organized. Like the campus run, but really together. Exercise outside with 50 people, so an event in 3 or 4 shifts, makes it very nice for 200 people to exercise together and run 5 or 10 kilometers."
1245,Nothing More
1246,I have had no problems. Only it is more difficult to arrange certain things (eg finding an internship).
1247,None.
1248,"Loneliness, lack of guidance, depression, a lot of uncertainty and dissatisfaction that I have not been able to give a place"
1249,There is Nothing Else At The Moment
1250,My points are all included in the previous answers of this survey. My main message: study itself - Excellent! Studying - Looking up the physical & mental limit!
1252,I have none
1253,Teachers hard to reach
1254,Depressive episodes
1258,Concentration of problems and uncertainty about schedule/timetable. The Lockdown also caused a lot of gloom complaints for me.
1259,"All will be fine, the end is good in sight"
1260,It Doesn't Feel Like My Voice Is Heard In The Aerospace Faculty
1262,"Few things that gave me energy, while I needed more energy to study, because of the great responsibility that the online study entails. It feels like more of you is being asked, while the circumstances make it difficult enough for you."
1265,It was very difficult that we could not go to the TU and had to leave the student atmosphere.
1267,"It would be great if there was some child of check on courses that have low passing rates, Maybe Something's Wrong with the way they are Being Taught."
1268,"Getting distracted during lectures, some lectures are not given live so you can't ask questions, don't find it necessary to take a shower or have breakfast for a lecture, which means I am not really awake, a waiting time of 11 weeks at the student psychologist, so you never have on time You can learn to manage stress, my sport couldn't go on so I tried many things (jogging, yoga, rugby, etc.) but nothing more than 3 times because I just didn't like it and therefore not exercise"
1269,"Live lectures often had little added value, sometimes recorded videos had helped better"
1271,- The ProCtoring at Probability & Statistics felt unnecessary
1274,not necessarily call it a problem
1277,"little social contact, tired eyes through screen, working at home too long,"
1278,"More understanding from the TU, since it has been very difficult for the students to have to sit at home so much and to have so little prospect."
1279,"Making a good layout for yourself in studying and non-studying is difficult. In addition, the motivation also dropped considerably, I prefer to be outside all day and in motion."
1280,Missing physical design education
1282,"By being an international student in recent months I have found it difficult to visit family and friends at home. In addition, the annual schedule of the Academic Year 2021-2022 and more time with friends makes almost impossible for me, so I don't have the impression that my mental situation will greatly improve. I doubt that they want to be more on campus between next year to have a better study experience or to want to be less on campus to be able to spend time with family easier."
1283,"Little exercise, lack of concentration."
1285,"Little contact with fellow students, more alone exercising and learning and a boring life."
1286,"As a first -year students, I want to get to know more people of my year well. I feel that I didn't get that chance well and I think many others experience the same thing. It would be nice if something was done in the 2nd year in September in terms of group formation, or at least not a different working group every quarter but keeping it as possible."
1287,"Many are alone, fewer people speak, much in the same room, little variation in my days."
1289,Little individual help and openness to students. There were only general tips for studying at home and no help about personal situations until you contacted a study advisor.
1290,On Campus Study Place
1293,I felt very lonely while studying at home. Especially being able to easily ask a fellow student or keeping a coffee break I missed a lot.
1294,no specific needs
1295,More free choice less rule from the university. Think for yourself instead of the proverbial herd. More real lectures.
1296,"See few friends and do not really have the opportunity to study together. That helps very much with motivation, because once it is gone it becomes very difficult."
1297,"I cannot follow online instructions because the balance between classroom and individual working is no longer good (I do mathematics).
 I have discovered that without the hold of lectures and instructions at set times, I can plan very badly when I work on which subject (I can't do two unfinished things in one day, but I cannot do the homework for a course in one day off)."
1298,a
1299,Very difficult to get in touch with professors who hardly respond to their mail. Less motivation to do things because everything is online.
1301,Nonshole
1302,It is very difficult to separate study from your private life. Especially during the coronac crisis where your private life is almost 0. I once worked over myself once and the feeling that I had during this time has come back a number of times because I went on studying for too long.
1303,"-
 
 Lack of contact with fellow students; - No contribution from the university for the Coronaproof making your home workplace or home studies; - It is annoying to get an uninspired mail from the Executive Board from time to time in which the 'resilience' of the students is praised (I have heard that term way too often now), while there is not really noticeable something for the students is done to meet them. It would have been nice if, for example, the rector Magnificus would organize some more activities, perhaps of a playful nature, to stay in contact with students. For the future: Prof. Fokkema visited Studenthuizen to talk to students and find out what is going on in their world, and read the newspaper together ('Read with the rector'). It would be very cool if Prof. van der Hagen would restore this to its former glory!"
1305,I Feel Like If Enough Students Are Vaccinated It Should Be Possible to Attend on Campus Lectures
1308,I Just Feel Really Burnt Out. I find it nigh on impossible to concentrate at this point. Let me get that summer vacation and I'll be back in tip top condition.
1309,no not really
1310,It is more difficult to bump into fellow students and staff and get ideas and feedback from almost a random person.
1312,"Low participation rate in online lessons -> frustrating.
 Measures, or relax thereof -> little support, poor compliance, high group pressure, unsafe feeling on campus."
1314,"I'm paying too much in tuition, and since the next academic year is going to be my thesis period, I will be consuming virtualy 0 university resources. Therefore, My Tuition Should be dramatically Discounted because I am Contributing No Expenses to the University."
1315,seclusion
1316,Feeling of real studying is missing
1317,"Because I did a year of dream team, I don't know anyone in this year. Because of Corona I can't really get to know people."
1320,"Working online at your computer for whole days is very tiring and in my case has sometimes led to a headache, but it is still a kind of mandatory because of the high workload, especially in the first year because the BSA has to be achieved here"
1323,At home education is all pleased from studying
1324,"Bad communication from the faculty. Discouraged the danger of Covid, on-campus keep pushing. Denying the seriousness of the situation, at the last minute still have to switch to online education and to be very poorly prepared for it."
1325,"No guidance, no contact with students / professors."
1326,"Online education gives little motivation, the distance between teachers and students has grown as well as the distance among themselves between students"
1328,Insulation of fellow students by not being in the vicinity of others since there was no reason to only go to rooms during Lockdown
1329,"A number of professors indicated that there is certainly more room to give lessons, but for some reason that does not happen. I wonder why not. Does the TU do not want that or do the professors themselves don't feel like making an effort?"
1331,"Only are the contact with fellow students, no motivation, too little exercise and not enough to come out"
1332,"Not really, I Liked the Questionaire, I Hope it Helps."
1333,"Feeling lonely, concentrating for a longer period (long hours and many days in a row) in a small room"
1337,I think if Tu Delft Really Needs to Support the Students More. It or Feels Like a Place Where Professors Mind Their Own Business and We Have To Constantly Bother Them to Get Our Work Done a. Also the High Tuition Fees For International Students Need to Be Re Assessed A
1338,no
1341,concentration problems. No place to study at the TU. Less inspiration by fellow students
1343,difficulty finding a graduation place; loneliness in the house; Changes in sport options means that you cannot build a rhythm; depression; difficulty taking care of myself
1344,"The intense dichotomy that you are either a 'Mak Schaap', or a 'Coronawhappie'. Don't agree with certain policy actions is no longer an option. It ensures tacit dealing with other people, because when you open your mouth you run the risk of being put out. It has ensured that you will be paralyzed.
 I also had a lot of problems with extra Corona measures that come up with authorities that make no sense anymore. For example: on student associations you also have to keep 1.5 meters away from your housemates/relationship because the municipality of Delft has given up this extra rule to associations. Student associations generally have very strict rules while on a terrace or on a field in Hout, Delftse Hout, you have much more freedom.
 
 One of the biggest problems I have experienced is that your entire life moves to an online environment, and this is mentally too tiring to keep track of. A lot of people in my area have stopped studying because it cannot be done this way. I myself have also decided to only follow small courses so that I have the rest of the week to recover. If the decision is made that studying remains hybrid for the time being, it means that I will have to stop my studies."
1346,"Lack of spontaneous social encounters is NR1, after which sport must remain possible in the gym"
1347,"I Truly Believe IDE HAS Low Quality Ánd Low Quantity Study Advisors, Speaking From Experience and Expressing Others' Opinions As Well"
1350,No
1352,no
1355,"Anxiety, stress, lack of motivation, concentration problems, fatigue"
1357,Reduced social contact.
1358,"Furthermore, I think it is bad that they constantly bring young people in the news in the news due to a few rotten apples. Furthermore, the definition of young people is used terribly broadly. 12-18 are young people according to the media, but as soon as someone of 29 does something wrong, it is also a young people. That is bothering me. Copied from the previous question"
1359,Working together in a project group is not easy from home
1361,I have none
1363,No
1365,"Few distracting incentives, making it difficult to study all day long"
1366,No
1367,"Getting contact with teachers can sometimes be very difficult. Furthermore, during my Bep it was sometimes difficult to arrange deliveries/make agreements with people at the TU. Furthermore, I don't really have trouble with the online lessons"
1368,No
1369,"Living alone, everything that takes place within the same walls, structure totally lost, despite videoetings the feeling of not really interacting, concentration problems"
1370,No social life
1371,"I am afraid that next year at tu will be on campus and certainty will appear too late, when finding accommodation will be tough."
1374,Nonshole
1375,Motivation problems because you are in the same place in your own room every day. Concentration problems due to a lot of distraction
1376,"You don't just come across people at the TU anymore. For every contact you have to actively agree and it is not feasible to do that anyone because there is too little time is or contact with some people is not so good. As a result, a lot of contact with fellow students falls away and you are just aware of a small group."
1377,"Through the home studying there was a poor relationship between study and private life. I also often could not concentrate well through the crowds at home. In addition, the structure disappeared. I hope fat everything will get normal again soon and I can just go back to the TU as it should be"
1378,This survey makes me feel heard and it shows that the tu is trying to hear input from its students. It gives me a bit of hope for the future
1380,nonshole
1381,"Motivation lacks because all subjects are alike, even the most interesting then becomes boring."
1382,- Much more tiring by zooming all day
1383,I am not happy with the way the architecture faculty has chosen studios for our final year
1384,"I no longer have a motivation to watch lectures. I still follow very little, only the courses you do together"
1385,Nonshole
1386,"Almost all of my social contact took place at the university, and Corona has all dropped and only realize how only I really am. I am not the best in social interaction and making new friends is not that easy. Not now but not for Corona. At the same time, I am not motivated enough to really make an effort. I also have trouble with my thesis. Case imposter syndrome. I feel that I am just bumping around, and I even get paid for it. I feel guilty and not good enough to get something worthy enough to publish"
1387,Interaction with the Thesis Supervisor
1388,"Feeling little connectedness because you only see people through a screen, having difficulty sitting at home all day, few people get to know in your first year because there is little allowed in the social field"
1389,"1st year this year have been able to make very little contact with each other, so they quickly feel all and you don't have the idea that you are doing the study together. In this way it is also more difficult to ask someone about things that you do not understand, so that a lot comes to us what we all have to sort out ourselves."
1390,Suffer from a lot of stress. And always the feeling that a guidance is a presentation
1391,Sitting in the same space all day makes you crazy
1392,"Very little opportunity to get to know fellow students personally
 Extra stress around exams because they have to be taken at home and each course has a different way and degree of proctoring
 Many friends seen very little and spoken by lockdowns and closed club society"
1393,"In the beginning I held my social contacts very much, because I lost someone in my nearby area to Corona and I didn't want to do this to someone else. Because of this I saw few people, at some point I decided that that was no longer tenable and I went to see a little more people. Especially since I had to do a few more courses that could actually be completely independent, I hardly had any contacts."
1395,Student Finance for Non-EU Students Who Face Troublebkls Financing Their Studies
1396,Keep motivation in it
1397,Bad lectures. Looking back from lectures that are not included properly. No guidance from the TU.
1399,"Keep school and private life separate, energy level"
1401,"The faculty needs to stop putting all deadlines at the same time and tell us 'Oh we know it's hard, but ...'. Simply Spread out the work load!"
1402,"Insomnia, study backlog, depression"
1403,I just don't know a specific problem
1404,Sometimes there was a lot of uncertainty for me as a first -year student about what should actually happen in a profession.
1405,Contact with fellow students and professors was not optimal
1407,Will Do
1408,My concentration level is very low and therefore I get a very high stress content
1409,"Little contact with master students, no improved help from a study supervisor, no physical home lectures, making some courses very difficult to follow"
1412,"I hardly follow any more courses and I am graduating. That's fine, so I have experienced few specific problems"
1414,More often a fixed neck/back.
1416,"Home insulation and lack of outdoor space in student houses was really a problem for me. I couldn't go anywhere during the Lockdown. I had my student house and that was it, a small common space and rooms during a lockdown is heavy."
1418,No separation between studying and just being at home.
1419,"Graduation is always a bit lonely and sometimes the motivation is hard to find, but during Corona where you live, eat, study and relaxed every day in the same room, it was extra difficult to stay motivated. ;)"
1420,Little connection with TU Delft. Little connection with people in Delft. More problems with concentration and less support for other students. Explanation is often more difficult because sketches over Zoom remain difficult.
1421,"Demotivated, little exercise, sitting all day, restless workplace."
1423,"Colleges at the TU please.
 Also make sure that courses that are online are well prepared and students give different options of studying, so for example not only videos but also blocks of text and vice versa"
1424,"There is a higher threshold by studying at home to approach teachers, where that had happened earlier if there were normally a study at the university"
1426,I would like the possibility to graduate at university and not at my computer
1427,Because of the coronacrisis we had to study at home and this did not work at all for me. I have always been someone who performs better at school than at home. Because of that home study I have not taken many courses
1428,no
1429,Arrangement of an on-campus Introduction Week for Students Admitted Duration the Academic Year 2020-21 would be appreciated.
1430,Little motivation. Bad study place. Less sports
1431,"Holding work rhythm, discipline with work and maintenance, balance between work and leisure, social contacts outside the Uni"
1432,A social life. That the elderly are not being pulled on people with a life for themselves. A place to study. PLZ PRZ PRZ
1433,"loneliness, concentration problems, little motivation"
1434,no
1435,"The lack of study place at the TU, the lack of variety in my days, the lack of people around me who are in the same boat (same subjects, teachers, assignments and problems)"
1436,"Money problems. Job is no longer there, I can't visit my parents in the weekends to live for free and stuff"
1437,Contact with the Projectgroep Online has become a bit stiffer after a longer period

1441,"The problems I experience during my studies are always there, Corona or not."
1443,"Feeling alone, closed, have no things to attract and look forward to it"
1444,"Not enough support. Very strict while students do their best to adapt (for example, exams that have been declared invalid for the smallest reasons)"
1445,- online lessons not followed on time
1448,"A better workplace, of course at home, had been very nice."
1450,Digital guidance for a design trade does not work
1453,Communication to students feels deteriorating during the coronacrisis. I also sometimes get the feeling that our situation is not taken into account at all
1455,My biggest problem during this crisis was that it was difficult to make new friends
1457,no
1458,Social contact with fellow students of your own study -> Being able to put certain tasks and things that are expected from the subjects that you follow.
1460,"Poor study place, too long waiting time for practice assistant and student psychologist, little recognition of overstrain (RPF is much too complicated to request)"
1461,"Been very sick from Corona, so I was very tired. After that, arose psychic problems (depression)"
1462,"fatigue by many, and especially long, online lessons"
1464,"Studying at home is really terrible, and physically you really feel bad about it"
1465,More Social Activities would be nice
1466,"TU Delft Councilers Should Stop Right Quuiting When u Come There For Help And Advice What Steps To Take, As Far As I Know All My Friends That Go to Study Concellers Were Told To Quit. And some of them Graduating this year, so its not like they will be kapable, so Quuiting Recommememdate is Just Bad Approach. For some of the courses professors should take more care for the course not putting every thing on bag when they are some sometimes equally provide wrong answers and misguide students, this is difficult fast pace studying (book: Java in 2 semesters, 8 weeks), So Proper Structure of the Course and Relayable Help is crucial."
1467,Nothing
1468,Too little school contact
1470,A lot of stress and very little motivation. Feels like I have thrown away from time for a year
1471,no
1474,"I felt left behind the uni between Dec and April, the online lesson environment was Zero to Non. It was literally all out for yourself, here is a list of old lectures and you just do it"
1476,"Motivation, contact with teachers is less, getting up, rolling to bureso, sitting behind laptop, back to bed, repeat ..."
1477,"Not being able to brainstorm in groups, not being able to go to UIS but your work is always at home, more stress, not seeing how others are doing, less benchmarked whether you are doing well, tiring, tiring"
1479,"Loneliness, panic attacks, hopelessness, frustration"
1480,"Certain professors who think along far too little, slides that are not good enough to study later"
1481,The degree of self -discipline has fallen enormously with my motivation. A number of teachers can handle zoom or other products poorly.
1482,little motivation
1484,"I feel lonely, and not part of the life that takes place here in Delft"
1485,"Physical contact but that has been clear to everyone in this time, gwn nice n hugle giving each other standing in the pub, being able to travel to a warm place in a full plane with enthusiastic people, can travel freely"
1486,No
1487,Project groups are more difficult due to limited contact. Group members cannot make themselves heard for a long time
1488,"No physical home lectures, no access to a place that is set up to study"
1489,"Much isolated. You also learn a lot from your fellow students. Because you speak to it less often, your study presetations will also deteriorate."
1490,The comunication and you can be forgotten very quickly
1491,"More difficult to get off a professional with questions, mailing is always mixed than just"
1492,No
1493,"loneliness, boredom, stress, fear that I cannot see family, angry with enforcement and poor regulation,"
1494,"I have many subjects without exercises with answers, which means that you never know if you are doing well. Contact with students is really necessary to study a little relaxed. I also have the idea that professors ask more from me than the EC that stands for it. Finally, I have the idea that the courses do not take each other into account."
1495,thank you
1496,Too little understanding of teachers in terms of circumstances
1497,The use of fully online lens environments for the Master Applied Physics is not possible and has significantly reduced the level of the course and has dramatically reduced the knowledge gained.
1499,Build less good relationship with teams. Along with girlfriend (who lives in the same apartment) have online meetings
1500,Nothing More
1501,"I wanted to do an internship abroad, that was not possible. Monotony."
1502,"If there was the possibility, I often forgot that you could reserve a place on campus. The weeks also have hardly any structure and fly past which gives an unhappy feeling. Some teachers do not record their lessons 'because they would not really do that in real life' which can be particularly frustrating (overlapping subjects for example). It would be nice to be able to talk to a person about questions about previous lessons, but there is often no room for that in the online lessons. You can, however, ask the question of BS which often helps, but sometimes I would rather discuss with someone."
1504,"Take a little more psychologists, not only because there would be a wave of mental displeasure ... but also simply because this was all pushed away in the past and the recognition of the problem is only starting by dusk, an annual short conversation for Every student would be great, I think, if people say they have no issues, that's nice, but there are plenty of people with issues who have never allowed it."
1505,"I would like to thank tu delft for making sure duration thesis 'tryping times' we can still destroy our careers with a single exam. I Lost My Job, My Hobbies, My Family, and the Little Piece of Mental Health I Had Left, Great To Know I Can Lose More."
1506,Motivation problems
1509,Completely finished with all those screen hours
1511,"No motivation, poor contact and few people get to know"
1512,"Citizens who blame all students for all problems such as parties during Corona, while this is only a very small part, so that all students are then assessed extra strictly."
1513,"I think it is a shame that we are not allowed to use Discord for more courses, although that is one of the easiest programs for that kind of work"
1515,Not really
1516,I Wish I would have more personalized Guidance to plan My Future Studies/Career.
1519,After
1520,No physical education and decrease in motivation
1521,"Great lack of motivation and concentration. And every time there could be anything on the TU, that must be a very hassle again. I can't even start studying for an hour in the evening. I must necessarily make that and there are a specific (mostly awkward) time. With all due respect, but what nonsense is that?"
